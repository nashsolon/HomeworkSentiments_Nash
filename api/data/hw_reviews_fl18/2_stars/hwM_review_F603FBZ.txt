This homework is very long and the execution of the experiment is very long as well. It was hard for us to do the first problelm by hand since the graphs involved woul d be very messy. The second problem is a bit long and could be confusing when it comes to analysing the number of stages and tasks in the spark program. I'm not sure if we should follow the slide or just follow the data on Hues where the data seems unclear to me at this time.
