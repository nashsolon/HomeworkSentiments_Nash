this homework was so much more difficult and time-consuming than all the previous homework because of the code part of the homework. I like the fact that there is less writing in this homework compared to the other ones, but debugging the coding assignment part was extremely time-consuming, especially when I'm not very proficient in Java. It took me 2 hours to figure out how to test using the SentimentPartionTest java file to test my code because I am not familiar with Eclipse. Additionally, it also took a while for me to figure out how to read lines from a text file, after doing a lot of research on StackOverflow.
