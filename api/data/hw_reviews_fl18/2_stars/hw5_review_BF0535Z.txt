home work five is pretty okay. now i see that the study work is more geared towards to the implementation where we actually do the programming. it is hard but i kind like it. i still would appreciate more guidence though on the homework instruction file. This does not mean that the instruction itself is insufficient, but just more guidence would be helpful!
