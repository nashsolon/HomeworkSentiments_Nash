I'm very disappointed with the the teaching staff's handling of the teaching staff on this homework assignment. Multiple questions have gone unanswered in the days leading up the auxiliary due-date. Many students had to put off this homework assignment last week due to career fair activities, and, unfortunately, they are not receiving the help they trying to get.
