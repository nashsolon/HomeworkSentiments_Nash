Homework 4 was a struggle for multiple reasons. First of all, I did not allocate enough time to finish the assignment (spent about ~4 hours working on this). I got my problem #1 working in eclipse but not via hadoop, so I couldn't really answer questions b-f. The second part was reliant on the first, so I didn't finish that either.
