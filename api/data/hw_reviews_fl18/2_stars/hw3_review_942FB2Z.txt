I found HW3 more difficult than the previous homeworks, but it, like the previous homeworks, made me really think about the structure. The execution of MapReduce problem was really nice as I was led into executing the tasks and finding the outputs step by step and not looking everywhere to find out what I am supposed to be doing. I wasn't sure how much detail to put into number 3 and how much it was asking for.
