I think hw6 is interesting since we could implement an application for recommendation. It first appears to me very hard becasue we need to create our own top-n list's Mapper and Reducer, which is essentially lab5. I start falling deep into the weeds when constructing the job for first I need to figure out the logic of the job or what is needed to be implemented; then I have to use Hadoop/Java friendly language to realize them. Hope I could learn a lot more than I expected.
