I thought this homework assignment was especially hard, particularly problems 2 + 3. On problem 2, I was unsure of how to deduce these proofs and I did not have a good enough understanding of them from class. On problem 3, I felt like there were so many unfamiliar elements in the some of the reducing for job 2 that it made the problem very difficult for my partner and I.
