This homework was neither my favorite, nor my least favorite of the assignments.  While running a mapReduce job is interesting and dealing with the output is important, I found that the class explanation of YARN and textbook readings were insufficient in terms of my greater understanding.  I found the YARN question difficult to answer and found it hard to figure out what was even being asked.  I also found the skew question confusing.
