i gave this a 2/5 beause although the pig part was fine, the spark  felt pretty directionless. The material we did in lab on Tuesday was much simpler than the stuff on the hw and I felt very lost attepting teproblems because the error messages are hard to follow. Also there isn't  whole lot of material on spark online or in HTDG.
