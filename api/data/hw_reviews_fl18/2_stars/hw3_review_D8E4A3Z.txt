I think home work 3 is a fair homework. It is far more better than home 1. Actually, I think no home work will worse than homework 1. But compared to homework 1, it is still not that good. The question a of question one is quite troublesoem, we need to use a lot of times to press the down button to find the correct answer. Question 2 is a goog question, I think. As to question 3, I think it is the same as question 3 of homework 1. The question is a little unclear. We can answer a lot of things in this question, but we can not make sure which one can get the point.
