this homework, finally, is getting shorter. Most importantly, it is getting
less code involved. Another thing is that, I had 2 weeks to do this homework.
Which means that I have been away from the course stuff for 1 week. Half
of the homework problems contains math. In fact, that is annoying too.
The amount of time I spent on this homework, is not that smaller than those
heavier ones. Anyway, this is it.
