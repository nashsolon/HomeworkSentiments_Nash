This homework is really tough for us. I dont like it. The context is good and we can learn a lot by doing it. But i dont think this is a good instruction sicne a lot of related code command and knowledge have not been mentioned by notes or book, so we really confused about some issue of it like how to achive chaining jobs, i think it would be better even the professor can offer some materials we can read and learn how to do it. By searching google it is time consuming and no efficient. Also, there is some contridiction like professor dont allow us to upload the dataset to svn but we need to using hadoop and yarn to collect statistical data.
