This homework was cool, but still not that cool since we had to use java. Problem 1 was good, but it was also annoying to debug through the different errors that I was facing, such as getting numbers in the output. Thus, I had to account for a lot of them and change my code accordingly. Number 2 and 3 were ok but I feel like they didn't really add much to my understanding because they just involved fetching answers from the book.
