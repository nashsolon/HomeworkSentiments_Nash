I did not like this assignment. I twas nice that there were a bunch of shorter problemsn, but for all the pig scripts it was not made known anywhere in the instructions that ad_data1 and ad_data2 were in different formats. In fact, by the wording of the questions and stubs it seemed that this should not be the case, and the fact that they were different made us very worried that this was a mistake on the instructors' part. If this were made clear to begin with, then I would have really enjoyed this assignment.
