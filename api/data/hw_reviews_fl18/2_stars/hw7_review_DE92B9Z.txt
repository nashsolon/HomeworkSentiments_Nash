This is a taugh task mainly because the unclear instruction, we follow the instruction steps to do the filter in mapper, but the results included some wired pairs like blackspace combined with word, or number with word, or single letter with word, we can figure out the reason there are single letter and number, but confused about why there would be blackspace as this is inconsist with our intution and logical thought, also, we assume these combines are meaningless when applying this program to do sentimental analysis, but the instruction seems no mention if we should filter these types. finally, we do it in the way as we thought should to be, even though we cannot gurantee that is what the homework want.
