This was my least favorite homework assignment so far because I ran into some data issues with Hadoop while doing it after running an incorrect join command that created a very large amount of output data which filled up my computer's memory disk. I think that some of the directions could have been more clear, as we ran into some issues joining the two ad data datasets because we thought they were both tab separated, when one was in fact comma separated. This assignent has taken the longest amount of time so far. Other than that I liked using Pig and Spark.
