 thought that the third homework assignment in 427 was not that effective in terms of actually learning new material. I thought  that it was somewhat helpful in understanding what different similarity scores mean but I do not think it went far enough in actually learning as it seemed like a pretty short lab where you just write a pretty easy job and then compare two different similarity scores.
