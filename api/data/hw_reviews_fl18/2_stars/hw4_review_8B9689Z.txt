This homework was a lot more loaded in terms of material and was worded very poorly. This made it harder to follow and finish on time. Question 1 was confusing because it wasnâ€™t clear as to what was expected of us. It would have been better if the instructions were clear or if TAs were a little responsive on Piazza. This homework did teach us how to use ToolRunner and Partitioner with our projects which I am happy about. Other than that, this homework made me frustrated.
