This homework basically gives me an impression of boring. Problem 1 is applying the definition we learned on course to evaluating several kinds of data. Problem 2 is a bit more interesting. But what we actually need to do is do the math exactly like the book did and come up with the right formula. Problem 3 is the least one I like. It brings me back to the days I prepared for GRE reading test.
