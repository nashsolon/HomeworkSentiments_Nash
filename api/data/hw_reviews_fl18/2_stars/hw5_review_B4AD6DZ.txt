I feel really dumb and a bit defeated in this one. I feel like i have never felt doing the lab first is this important. I did not finish my lab, so I went into the homework blind. I found myself stuck on a problem so I searched internet all day for it and counln't find an answer. Finally when I asked my friends about it and they just said "oh its on the lab slide" and I was like this is so dumb I wasted 7 hrs o this so I don't like this lab
