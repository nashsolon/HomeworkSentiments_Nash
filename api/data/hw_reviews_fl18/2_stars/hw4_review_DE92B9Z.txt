this homework is huge hard for us, the code execution mentioned in class is not detailed enough, so we have to learn how to implement them and review bunch of papers and articles. Also, maybe professor should emphaisze the important concepts and code on class would be better for us to do homework, since we find there did have the explanation about the concept and code on note but i totally has not remember professor has mentioned them on class. Anyway, this is a tough homework and we spent lots of time on it.
