This homework was pretty straightforward however it was hard to spot errors at times because all of the information/slides we were pulling from were in many different places. The biggest difficulty I found was trying to understand why I couldnâ€™t get 3 MapReduce tasks to run instead of one for Problem 2. Also, a lot of the instructions were unclear, which made it difficult to finish/debug.
