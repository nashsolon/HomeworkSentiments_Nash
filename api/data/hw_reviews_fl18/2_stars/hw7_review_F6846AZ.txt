hw7 doesn't have much coding work. It's mainly made up of analysis work of recommand system for  different method. However, I expected that we can code on the different approaches of recommandation system to experience the effect by ourselves. So, I hope there could be more coding work next time instead of the empty talk. What's more, I think the coding work could be more challengable(i.e less hint of homework coding in ppt).
