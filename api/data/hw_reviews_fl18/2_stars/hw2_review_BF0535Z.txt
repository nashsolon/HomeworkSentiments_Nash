I think homework two is good overall. It helps me go over the lab 1 again and has some reinforcement learning about the basic hadoop command lines and some options. Though I think there should be more help on the command line details because when I go to hadoop documentation for cat options there is no explanation or list for possible combinations of pipes. Other than that, I think the homework is help and helps me getting familar with the hadoop system.
