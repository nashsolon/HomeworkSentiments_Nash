This homework was a lot of work, which was good because I feel like I got some practice out of it but at the same time I really felt that the lectures and labs did not prepare me for this. I feel like the work we do in lab is a lot easier at times and lecture is too jumbled for me to understand most of what's going on. Additionally, I dont understand why we had a homework on Spark due two days after our lab on Spark -- that was very unhelpful and made me feel lost.
