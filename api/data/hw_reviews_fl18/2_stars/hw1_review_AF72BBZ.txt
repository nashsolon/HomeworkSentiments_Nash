I worked this assignment with a teamamte. By doing this assignment, we review the concept which mentioned in class. In addition, we also shared different thoughts on the same question. It's a good chance to learn more about the concept by taking to each other. It covers the basic concept and something new. However, the reading part is very hard and it's not related to our lecture. We spent much time on understanding the meaning behind the article. For students  whose native language is not english, they feel painful.
