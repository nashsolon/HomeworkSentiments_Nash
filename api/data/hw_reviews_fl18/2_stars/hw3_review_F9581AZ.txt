The first assignments are graded and we weren’t doing great. That’s a bummer. So we are kind of upset and panicked. I wasn’t motivated to start on homework3 at all. It took me 3 days to finish half of the questions and I felt guilty for not being as efficient as my partner. We reviewed the questions closely, validated and discussed with each other. I’m going to review them again before submission so I think it might be good?
