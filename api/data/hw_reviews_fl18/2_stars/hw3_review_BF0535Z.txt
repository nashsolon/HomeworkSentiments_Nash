I dont know what to say about hw3. Lots of check text book and ask google problems. And also some do it and see what the output is kind questions. I would say I'm definitely okay with that kinda of home, though I would prefer more hands on experience. For example like actually doing coding and submit it to run the hadoop and see the status update from the datanodes stuff like that.
