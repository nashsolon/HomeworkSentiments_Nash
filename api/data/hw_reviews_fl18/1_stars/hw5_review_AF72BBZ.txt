This assignment is harder compared to previous assignments. In HW5, it's required more skills on java code. Personally, I like coding part because it easier for me. For question 1, the most hardest thing is about regex. For question 2, the most hardest thing is about sort. For question 3, I finshed with my teammate, he was good at solving such problme. Anyway, regex and java code skills are needed in order to finish this assignment. And as I menthioned, this one is harder compared to previous assignments.
