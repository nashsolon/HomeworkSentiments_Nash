this homework doesn't make sense, althought it covers the materials we were taughted during class, that cannot support us to do this homework, also, it's really annoyed that the instruction got certain mistakes or unreasonable implemention as it would leads students to a totally wrong way and cost us tons of time to confused about where we made wrong and how to fix it, and finally we found it's the wrong in the instruction or something unclear caused it, this is really worthless and inefficient, hoping professor can double check the instruction in next semester to avoid it happen again since it definitelly harm the motivation of students to do the homework and learn something correctly.
