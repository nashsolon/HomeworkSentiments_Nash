I thought this assignment was kind of annyoing. The proof was really dull and not very clear so it was not enjoyable. The other problem was going through the whole cosine difference equation was interesting but somewhat tedious. In general while it was an interesting topic the overall assigment was dull. Pig will be an improvement.
