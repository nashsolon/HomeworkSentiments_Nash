This assignment is hard. If professor wants to give us some free bouns for extra assignment, please dont be mean. The page rank part is the same level to final project. This assignment requires students to finish all questions by using spark, python and pig. This is final term, and there is no much time to focus on this single assignment, Please, be nice! If you want to us some extra points. Not only because runing pig scripts is really slow, even in local job runner mode, it's also not flexible. For instance, I cannot filter out customers with orders less than 5 while I am doing the counting. At least I don't know how to do it. It is also really hard to debug the program since I cannot set break points.
