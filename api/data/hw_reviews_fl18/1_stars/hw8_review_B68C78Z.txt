There are 5 problems in homework 8 and I think this homework is hard because we have never used Spark or Pig to deal with data before. And I spent a lot of time doing some “set up” job and finally I get familiar with it. And in this process, I really felt bad and for many times I did not know what to do in the next step because I think the things we learned in class is not enough at all to finish the job so I have to Google for some functions and tried them time to time. I hope next time we could have enough information for us to finish homework..
