This homework is really tough, there are tons of problems and we cannot find clear referation to those problems in lecture notes or lab instruction, neither the online sources, so parts of questions can only be answered based on our experience and understanding of the spark, i think it's might be better to move out the spark part since they are not totaly covered in our process, so much questions are unclear and cannot be answered confidently according to what we learned on class.
