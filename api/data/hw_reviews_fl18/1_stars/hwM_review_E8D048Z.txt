The amount of this week's homework are pretty heavy, covering the last 2 weeks topic: pig and sparks. Really hope the homework can be less and easier. Problems 1~3, pig coding is really the new field that we've never touched before. Problem 4, the spark one, took a great amount of time to deal with since all commands has to be discovered through the API docs by lots of readings. It took us around 8 hours to finish. Don't like it.
