I continues to struggle with basic concept about HDFS level. This assignment is giving me a diffcult time in certain areas of HDFS. Areas in need of extra work are MapReduce. Working on these problme areas every week would help me improve my learning outcomes. Also, the coding part of this assignment is not easy too. Ispent much time on find some method about java using. The code for part two is harder than the code for part one in my opinion.
