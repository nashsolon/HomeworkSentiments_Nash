The first question was extrememly easy and did not teach students anything new. It was only 
busy work. The questions ask to provide your own comments but its really pointless because the 
files already have adequate comments in there. Some new comments could be written but students 
shouldn't be penalized for keeping some of the default comments if they make sense or describe
the methods correctly.

Question 1 also had a type and told students to look at the wrong files for submission. This was
very confusing and should be fixed. Question 2 also had some quirks. We never talked in class 
what key distributions were and TAs never logged into Piazza to answer this question. 

Question 3 was poorly written and the files needed to run this correctly were not specified well 
in the assignment. 

Because of the issues in this homework, I would rate it a 1 out of 5 stars.
