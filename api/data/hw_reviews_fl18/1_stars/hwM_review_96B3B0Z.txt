No lie, this homework was terrible. My partner and I had such a hard time with it because there was an overaching lack of directions. To elaborate, in question 3, the instructions say that the data was in hadoop, but it wasn't so my partner and i had to go digging for hours to find the data. In addition, question 2, my yarn resource manager didn't show the stats neccesary so i struggled for hours to find how to show it.
