this homework was very frustrating and rewarding at the same time. I used the local sample set in order to test and debug my code, but I wasn't able to confirm if it was correct or not. So, a lot of debugging had to be done with the entire dataset, which took a very long time and made the whole homework very frustrating. Although I felt like I learned more about PIG, it really reassured me that I don't want to use it ever again.
