In my opinion, hw4 is the hardest homework so far. Firstly, setting up eclipse and learning how to run the code took lots of time. Then, since hadoop did lots of work (i.e., group, sort) automatically and the question provides part of codes, it is hard to debug our code since we were not one hundred percent clear everything that was going on. Finally, running a Shakespeare test case took almost half an hour on our computer since we do not have a computer with large memory.
