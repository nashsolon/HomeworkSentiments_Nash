This homework was awful. It was impossible to be able to check your answers and nobody answered any questions on piazza other than the useless “restart your vm” question when the scala wasn’t working. Having to spend so much time troubleshooting and asking questions about what questions actually mean rather than learning is so frustrating. Why do we have to give the same answers twice for 1b and 2a?
