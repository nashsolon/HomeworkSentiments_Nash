I have to say hw9 is a pretty bad homework. There's no example for all 4 problems, especially the first one, we spent bunch of time figuring it because there was no even one example we can refer to. Also the second and thrid problems. The amount of time we worked on it was around 12 hours. I would rate very bad on this week's homework. Really request any example we can refer to.
