I personally really disliked this assignment. Not only was it boring, the instructions were unclear or ambiguous. On the occasion where the instructions were clear there was likely to be an issue with the data not being where they stated it was. On two occasions did we have to use random posts on piazza to solve major issues about missing data or missing system settings that had set us back way to long. Overall I was displeased with this assignment.
