This assignment is much harder compared to previous assignments. Some materials wasn't covered in lecture and in lab like change the format of ouput, read data from xml, using fucntions and etc. Python skill is required for this class but students may dont have time to catch up in a short time. If student already has thoese skills, there is no meaningful reason to take this course since they can learn it by self. Also, spark and pig are differecult, you could divide it into two parts as two assignments. After students finished pig part problmes, they may no any effort to keeping do spark.
