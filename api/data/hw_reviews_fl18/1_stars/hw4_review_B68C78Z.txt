This time the homework is totally different from what we did before. In the lab, we write some simple codes to use hadoop finishing some jobs. And then in the homework, we will need to use the similar way to finish some harder but more realistic job. This home work makes me realize what cloud computing is about in real world because before I only had some concepts about it. But as it is our first time using hadoop to process out own code, I have met many troubles and wasted a lot of time.
