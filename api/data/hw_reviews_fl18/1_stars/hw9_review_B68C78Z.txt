This time I think the homework is very hard. Not only because it requires us to run different kinds of codes in different places(I only think it's hard but it's useful), It also has some problems that are not related to our class. For example, there is a problem in the file given to us to run, but we should comment some code out or we can not run that file. And there are also problems about memory of svn. I think it's too hard for me to handle all these additional problems in one homework.
