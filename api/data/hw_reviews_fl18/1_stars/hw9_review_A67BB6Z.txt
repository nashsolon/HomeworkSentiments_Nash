This homework was the most difficult homework of all. Using flume to put the weblogs in HDFS could cause a lot of bug and not correctly produce a good result, and resulting operations with Spark could have produced faulty results. Also, it was not clear on how to efficiently join RDDs. Finally, the PageRank efficiency was very confusing and I could not find a definite answer from the slides.
