I think hw8 is the worst homework among all the given one. The instruction of the code is not clear enough and the ta is not helpfulat all. I waste a lot of time because of the unclear of the problem and the instructions. I think next year, ta should make the problem more clear. But, I do get something from this homework, but in total, it is a really bad one.
