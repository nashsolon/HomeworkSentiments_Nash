Overall this was an enjoyable set of homework questions. While it was shorter than the other ones, I feel that by actually writing code for map reduce, as well as the partitioner, I learned a reasonable amount. While on one hand, I wish we were simply given more comprehensive tests to help determine if our partitoner was working, having to come up with our own was also a good learning experience. My partner blew up his setup, which took a long amount of time to troubleshoot, but other than that it was a good set of HW.
