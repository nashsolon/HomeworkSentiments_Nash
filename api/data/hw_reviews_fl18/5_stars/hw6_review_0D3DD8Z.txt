This homework was pretty fun. I liked that I had to start this from scratch(kinda) and it was very rewarding to finish it by myself. However, I did encounter lots of small errors that hindered my progress for a while and made it very hard for me to get past the first problem. As soon as I found the error, though, I realized that the homework is not too bad. This is my favorite one so far although it has been pretty challenging overall.
