There are 3 problems in homework 7 and I think this homework is very great! It’s different from the previous homework as this time it only requires us to write a little code. And I think it’s good because we are familiar with writing codes to do map reduce job now and do not need more additional practice. And this time we have a lot of problems to analyze or calculate, which are closely related to what we learned in class. I think theses are very helpful.
