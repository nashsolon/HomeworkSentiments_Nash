In my opinion, this homework is interesting. It is always my dream that write my own program and run it on my own. So this homework provides me such an opportunitiy. Some part of the program are hard to implement. Fortunately we got a reference. We can get some hint of key steps from reference and put them into our own idea. That is funny. I really enjoy myself when wrting programs.
