HW8 was good. Pig is really good. I know spark will be even better. Pig is so much easier then having to write and compile Java code over and over. And it's faster. Makes you wonder, why did we have to write jave code in the first place. Or at least there isn't a a good reason to spend so much time implementing jobs with java. Wrote so many lines of repetitive useless code in Java.
