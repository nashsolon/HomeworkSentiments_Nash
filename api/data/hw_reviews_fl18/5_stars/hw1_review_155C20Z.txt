This is my first homework of cse427s. Everything is very fresh. I start learning new knowledge about big data. Meanwhile, the first homework is not difficult, but it does take a while to fully complete all the requirements, especially reading a paper for an international student. Additionally, the second problem concerning evil-doers is very interesting and I enjoy it very much. I wish to keep doing well in the future.
