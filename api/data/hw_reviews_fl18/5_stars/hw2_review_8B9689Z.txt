This homework was relatively easy compared to the first homework. It was the perfect length because 3 questions seems like it is very doable and everybody can finish on time. Another thing that i liked about this homework was that questions 2 and 3 were based off of the example we did in the lecture and the lab which helped understand the steps of a MapReduce. Overall, i was very satisfied with the assignment and felt like i have a good grasp on MapReduce now.
