I like hw9, becasue I learded a lot about the pyspark, I learned how the lazy execution is working and how to avoid the memory shortage problem, at the same time, as a beginner, I become more proficient with python and the spark job execution. I remembered that I memtioned before that the respond speed in piazza is too slow, however I didn't see any progress in fixing this problem, that's what I am not satisfied.
