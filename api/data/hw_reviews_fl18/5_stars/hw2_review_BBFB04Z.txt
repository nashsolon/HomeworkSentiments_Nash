Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and hadoop is really helpful to me to understand the content coming from class. HW2 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop system. Overall, I enjoy HW2.
