I think this homework is a very great introduction to Big data application. It makes us think about the concept before jumpping into actual code and math. However, I think some concepts in the "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data" are hard to understand based on the materials we had now. Anyway, I like this homework pretty much. Thank you.
