It was a good homework. The first question helped me assess whether I understood the topics discussed in the first lecture. The second question demonstrated well that when we have big data, if we are not careful when we are setting our parameters, we will end up with false positives. The paper reading question was helpful because it discussed a practical approach and its limitations.
