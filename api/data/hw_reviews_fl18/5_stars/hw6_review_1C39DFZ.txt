As usual, hw6 is not bad, I learned a lot of programming skills and debugging methods while doing this homework, but I am kind of not satisfied with the points I earned from hw5, I don’t receive detailed feedback form TA, I mean, I don’t know why I lost the points, there is no information provided for that. I hope there will be some improvements next time.
