Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW3 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR system. And HW3 give me comprehensive understand of MR jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW3.
