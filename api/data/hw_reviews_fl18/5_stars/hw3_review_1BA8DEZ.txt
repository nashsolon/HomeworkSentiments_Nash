I think this homework is very tricky. Although it does not contain much maths or coding, it helps me to grasp different concepts firmly. It navigates me through slides, textbooks, and Lab two material. It took me more than 5 hours to finish that. Although it's kind of exhausting, it toally worths my effort. Thanks~~
