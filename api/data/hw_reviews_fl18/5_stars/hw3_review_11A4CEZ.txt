It has the same good side as the previous one, as it requires me to finish the corresponding lad to be able to start it, which is very good in my opinion. This home is somewhat time consuming though. I donâ€™t mean that it is not supper hard but I definitely need to put some effort in to finish it. Hopefully, I can get a better grade than the first one.
