Actually, hw5 is a good one, it gives specific instructions to us, but we still need to do something by ourselves, thatâ€™s a good strategy to teach us, the teacher gives us a direction and some guidance, then for the rest, we have to figure them out with our efforts. My suggestion is: if the problem description can be more detailed, it would be easier for us, because we can save a lot of time in Piazza.
