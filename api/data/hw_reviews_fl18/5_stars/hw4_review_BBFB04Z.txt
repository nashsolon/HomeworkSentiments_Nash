Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW4 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR job running and configuration. And HW4 give me comprehensive understand of MR jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW4 very well.
