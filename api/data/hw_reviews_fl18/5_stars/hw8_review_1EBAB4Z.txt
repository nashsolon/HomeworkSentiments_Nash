This homework was more practical and I liked that. It demonstrated how we can use map-reduce,pig,scala etc. to solve real world problems. It helped me work through how pig commands. Working on that problem I understood the need for a local data set sample to run and debug the script before using the huge file in HDFS. Overall, it was a good and practical homework.
