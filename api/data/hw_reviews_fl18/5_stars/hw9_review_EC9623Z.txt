In this homework, I learned how to write spark jobs and make it run. I am so interested in Big Data, so this course is really my type. Sometimes, I may feel confused about the differences between Pig and Spark, but gradually, I found that they vary a lot because their functionality are totally different. I will continue commiting to this homework and I hope the instructor can give us more exercises.
