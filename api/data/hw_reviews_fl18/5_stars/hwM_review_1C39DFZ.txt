I thinks hwM is pretty good, I refreshed my knowledge of PySpark and Pig Latin, the iteration algorithm deployment in problem 2 helps me to prepare the final project, which is k-means clustering, so itâ€™s all good for me, I did this homework because I screwed up in hw7, hw7 is terrible. I think you really need to improve the respond speed in piazza.
