Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW5 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR job running and configuration. And HW5 give me comprehensive understand of secondary sorting jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW5 very well.
