I thought that this homework was good for reinforcing pig and spark. Doing ETL with Spark was interesting for me as I thought it was really cool how we could do the entire process in just a few lines of code. Essentially, we just needed to import the helper methods from the provided pyspark file, create the RDDs and map them to "account_number:model" strings in one line, and then save them to the output directory in another line.
