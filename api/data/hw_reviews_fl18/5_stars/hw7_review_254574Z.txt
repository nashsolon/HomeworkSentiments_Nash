I really liked this homework, and really any homework that involves Shakespeare data, because I think it's really cool information to have. My partner and I did have some clarification questions, but not as many as in some previous homeworks. I think this really helped me understand the differences between stripes and pairs, as well making those concepts generic enough for me that I can separate them in my mind from job one in item recommendation.
