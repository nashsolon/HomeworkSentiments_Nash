This homework teaches me how to run the MapReduce in a real word, which makes me excited because I finally get some practical experiences. Moreover, this homework introduced some tricks that I can use to test my code and implement it faster by local testing and configure some key parameters using command line. However, I also have some advice to this class are that instructors can provide us more examples and code snippests to illustrate the concepts in the lectures. I think it is always a good method to explain code using real word instances.
