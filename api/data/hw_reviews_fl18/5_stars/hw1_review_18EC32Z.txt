I thought that this homework was fairly straightforward and a good introductory homework. The first part allowed us to better understand big data characteristics and how they exist in some concrete examples. The second part allowed us to apply some math from the textbook. I thought that the article in the third part was interesting. Writing about the data-based approach described in the article and its limitations allowed us to better understand the approach.
