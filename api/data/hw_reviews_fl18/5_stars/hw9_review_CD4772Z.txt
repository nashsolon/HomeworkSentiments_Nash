This homework didn't take too long but it was somewhat confusing mostly because I still don't completely understand the difference between running Spark on the cluster vs. client and how those actually work. This homework requires a lot of screenshots when it comes to the code part and it would have been nice if we could just submit the script that we executed instead of having to screenshot.
