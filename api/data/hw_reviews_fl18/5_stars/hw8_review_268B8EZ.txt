In this lab, there seems to be so many problems. But I found the first three are very similar once you understand how to implement a pig program. The first one is a little bit tricky and took me a lot of time to finish it. The process doing this homework is not very pleasant. When I did first program. There came a lot of problems since I didn't finish my lab7 firstly. Since then, I decided to read the preparations for a homework. It's very helpful.
