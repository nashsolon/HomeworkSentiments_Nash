HW2 is a good one, you need to understand what you are really doing, and you need to analyse the problem carefully in order to get the right answer. The problems are not seperated, but connected really close, for example, problem 2 and 3 are close. The connected problems give you a full understanding of the knowledge you get. Anyway, it's a good assignment.
