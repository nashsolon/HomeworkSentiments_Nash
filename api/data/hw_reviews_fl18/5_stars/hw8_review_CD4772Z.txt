This homework requires a lot of reviews for different materials including PIG and Spark, especially since the Pig lab was a while ago and I didn't remember anything about the syntax. The homework was a little difficult since it involved materials that weren't taught so I needed to go through the slides a few times to understand. However, there's not much writing required in this one which is nice since normally the conceptual ones also take me a while to write down the answers. The coding also feels better since it's no longer in Java.
