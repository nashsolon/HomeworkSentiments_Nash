This homework is pretty hard for me. Problem 1 may took 2 to 3 hours to finish. It introduces the ToolRunner so that we are able to pass stuff into driver using command line. For problem 2, the instruction seems a little ambiguous. So it took me pretty long to finally understand what to do. Also for the test part we need to firstly don't use distributed cache to pass the test, then change it to distributed cache to fullfill the requirements.
