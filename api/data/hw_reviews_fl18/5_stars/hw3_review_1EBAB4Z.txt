HW3 was helpful in exploring the output of the map-reduce word count program we looked at in lab2. It did a good job in exploring the very first step(record reader) and the very last step(writing outputs) of the map-reduce process. It also helped me understand the idea of skew and how reduce skew better. The third question solidified my understanding of YARNâ€™s job execution process.
