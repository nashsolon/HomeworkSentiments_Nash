I think this assignment is a very good one because the worload is not that big. Also, the whole homework is a lab, it gives us more opportunities to parctice. The question in the homework is very clear, we know exactly whta we need to do in this homework. This is quite different from the previous homework. I hope in the future, the homework can also be that clear. What's more, the hint given in this problem is good and helpful. So, in my opinion, it is a perfect homework.
