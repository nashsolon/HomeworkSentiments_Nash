I thought homework 9 was good practice with the materials and the concepts were interesting.  I also thought that it was a much more manageable workload than some of the other assignments.  I did not like question 4 part b as much, because there was no place this information was taught to us in the class.  Therefore, the only way to find out the answer was through google, which was pretty ineffective, or through asking ta's for help.  In general, I think the inclusion of conceptual questions that we did not learn the answer to in class is not the best idea because they are not measuring our understanding of the material accurately.  I thought that overall, though, the spark problems were interesting and logincally challenging enought to be fun to complete.
