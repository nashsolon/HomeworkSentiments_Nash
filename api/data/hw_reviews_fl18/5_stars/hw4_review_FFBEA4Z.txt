I thought that this homework was very good.  The concepts covered were interesting, and I enjoyed applying what I’ve learned about map reduce to perform an actual task such as a sentiment analysis.  I learned more about how toolrunner works than I would’ve been able to in lecture, and I found the implementation of average word length and sentiment analysis to be very helpful to my understanding of the concepts.
