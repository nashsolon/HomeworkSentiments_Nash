This homeword differs from previous homeworks, demonstrating the practical utilization of mapreduce into real word, which advances my understanding of cloud computing. In previous lasseons, what we've learned mainly focus on conceptual phases, ranging from HDFS key components to some key APIs to implement. However, hw5 provides us an insight to make my mapreduce program happen in a very commen issue-recommendation systems. By finishing this howwork, I think my understanding of cloud computing and mapreduce will be strengthened, which is good.
