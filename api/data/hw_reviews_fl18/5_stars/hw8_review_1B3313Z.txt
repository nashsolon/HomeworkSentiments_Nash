I really like how this assignment is about both pig and spark. I enjoyed this very much because I did the labs well and I was able to implement and elevate my knowledge from labs in the homework. We submitted the HW a few hours before the deadline and it was a safe move. I am happy with this and the last assignment because we did a very solid job on both.
