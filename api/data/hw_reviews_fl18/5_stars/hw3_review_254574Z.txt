I think this homework was very helpful in clearing up, or at least solififying, a lot of the diagrams MapReduce we drew in class. I did find the Skew question to be a little confusing just because of the difference in terminology between class and the textbook, but I think it's content was very good to learn. I also liked that the first problem was about semantic analysis, a topic I am personally interested in myself.
