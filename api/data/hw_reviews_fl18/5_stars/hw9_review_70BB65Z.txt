INTERESTING.VERY INTERESTING. I know this review, is going to be part of the
sentimental analysis data set. The reseacher is going to find this review negative
, but it can't, it just can't, figure out, how royally pissed I am, with 
the homework. It is disatrous. I am totally done. Yes. Usually, I will sigh,
with such hard things encountered in my life. But today, it is, anger. The
lurking anger inside of my deepest heart, has erupted, today. Needless to say,
how many time I have spent on the homework. It is just, I feel the effort,
doing such debugging stuffs, is wasted. It is by the time, the worst thing
in my life, I could imagine. My efficiency on study, has been greatly reduced
by this. OK. Let's stop. Enough words, and I am calm now.
