This homework does not have a heavy load. It leads me to go through how to use Spark to process information and generate valuable conclusions. As the final exam comes close, I have a lot of materials to review. It may take a lot of time for me to finish the homework. However, I still consider it as a good exercise to review what I have learnt.
