For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in class about the characteristic of big data. Through this, I not only remember what the characteristic is, but also have a deep understanding about what actually the characteristic is. 
For problem 2, the question asks us to read something first, and then do a similar problem. The knowledge is based on the probability which we learned in undergrad. But there is a little trick thing that the textbook does not mention a detailed process about how to calculate the probability about living in the same hotel. We need to think carefully when do the homework by ourselves, otherwise, we might not be able to get the test examples past. 
For problem 3, the question asks us to read an article and do some reading problems. To tell the truth, I am not good at summarizing the info from the article. I think all info would be useful. So this problem takes a lot of time for me. But I still think that this is a good practice for me, since the costed time would be shorter if I practice more.
