Problem 1 is a good problem, when I first see this problem, I was confused because we always need 2 jobs to achieve the goals we wan, but there are only 2 files in the directory. Then I figured out that there is only one user and we can ignore the job1, this is really a good problem.
The other 2 questions are also good, help me to understand the similarity and co-occurrence better.
