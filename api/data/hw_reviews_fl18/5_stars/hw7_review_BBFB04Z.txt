Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW7 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR job running and configuration. HW7 connected to real world application, which is quite exciting to work with. And HW7 give me comprehensive understand of co-occurence jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW7 very well.
