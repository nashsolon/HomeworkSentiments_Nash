Homework 9 seems nice to me, because it is not spread the work too much We will implement most of the work in Spark so I think that we could have a rounded training and testing on how to run Spark jobs. It is also very practical and seems very useful and applicable in real world. One more thing that may not related to the homework 9 per se but has some connection with homeworks. I wonder if we could release the hw9 for each week a little bit earlier and have some "alarms" for us to know that a homework has been added. Coz e erytime on thursday that I suddenly knew that there was a homework due on Thursday. Fortunately, late submission is always allowed. But it still grants me so little time to work on homework. Thanks!
