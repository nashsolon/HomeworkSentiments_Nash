I think this is a very meaningful homework. Before doing this homework, I do not have a very clear idea about what is distributed catch and configuration. After doing this homework, at least I know how to implement them. However, I think the homework is a little diffcult for the people who use hadoop for the first time. Especially, there is no example about these implementation. I think the homework can be better if the ta can provide us some more exmaples. But overall, it is a very good and useful homework.
