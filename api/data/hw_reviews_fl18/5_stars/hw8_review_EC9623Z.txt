What I love most in this homework is the practical analyis experiences it gave to us. This homework includes two ponents:
one is the Pig and another one is the Spark. By using them together, we may find the differences between them, which is good.
However, I think there are some points that can be improved further. For example, if we can get more instances and more details abou the princeples, which is what we should learn
at WashU because I consider us as creator instead of worker who only knows how to implement them but ignore things behind the scece.
