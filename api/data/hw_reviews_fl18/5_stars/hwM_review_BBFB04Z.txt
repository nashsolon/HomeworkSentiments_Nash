Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HWM gives me alot chance to practice the spark skill and improve my understand of pyspark job running and configuration and also pig job. HWM connected to real world application, which is quite exciting to work with. And HW9 give me comprehensive understand of spark and rdd. Overall, I enjoy HWM very well.
