Homeword talks about some basic MapReduce concepts and simple examples of mapreduce paradigm which can be finished with draft paper. I like this assignment is because memorizing is not enough for understanding mapreduce, and I think the best way to test whether one has a big picture about mapreduce is to write out each result after every step. By doing so, we know the workflow of mapreduce and it can lay a solid foundation for our future learning about mapreduce.
