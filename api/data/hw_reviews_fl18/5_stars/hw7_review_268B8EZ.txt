In this homework, I finished my code and do the homework all by myself. After that, I checked my answer with another student and we submit in group. It surprised me that it's such a easy way to submit a file shared by both of us. In this homework, I reviewed how to implement collabrative filter and finished the word co-occurance coding work in hadoop. It's a very interesting process.
