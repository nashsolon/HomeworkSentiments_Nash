This homework expanded my understading on how co-occurance works. It was helpful to get a practical implementation of the toy example from the lab(even though we are doing a differnt thing here in the homework the idea is the same). It was also helpful in demonstrating the need for collabrative filtering and the example demonstrated well how that works. Overall it was a good homework.
