Homework 6 was a great assignment. First of all, I allocated enough time to finish the assignment (spent about ~3 hours working on this). I got both Problems #1 and #2 working. Problem 1 asked us to use the code from Lab 5 to complete it, and I had a working copy of the Lab, so modifying that code took almost no time. Also, part 2 could be completed very quickly as it was conceptual from part 1. Loved this homework, favorite one of the semester.
