I'd like to give this hw a 5 star because this homework gives me practival experience to build a complete mapreduce job that can be applied in the real word, which is the most useful thing for this class from my point of view. Moreover, I think this homework can be promoted by integrating more subtle sections that explains more details and give students intuitives about what's going on behind the scenc.
