Oh no, another one? At this point, I'm running out of adjectives. This homework was not so lengthy but it still took
me a whole night to do it. I don't know if I'm just stupid or what. Thank god I had a teammate this time and he
definitely helped a lot. Without him, I would probably not have it finished in time. Please give me more of this
so I can loss more hair.
