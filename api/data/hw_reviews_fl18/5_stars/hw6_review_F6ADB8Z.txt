The homework this time asked us to write a MapReduce Job from scratch, which is pretty challenging. But since we already have a lot example files from before and a github link to reference, the difficulty of it is not that high. In the first problem we wrote all the files needed and run it on a pseudocluster at last. In the second problem we add a combiner to it and observe the bytes read and wrote during the job using YARN.
