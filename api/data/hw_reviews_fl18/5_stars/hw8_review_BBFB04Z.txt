Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW8 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of pig and pyspark job running and configuration. HW8 connected to real world application, which is quite exciting to work with. And HW8 give me comprehensive understand of pyspark. Overall, I enjoy HW8 very well.
