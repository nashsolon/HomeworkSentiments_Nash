Homework 2 does a very good job at review the materials covered during the lab and lecture. The first problem involves some of the key concepts in HDFS and I actually need to read the book vary carefully to answer some of the questions. The problem also reminds me to read the book so that I can memorize the concepts. Problem 2 and 3 are my favorite problems so far because tackled the practical mapreduce question, and they both served as great practicing examples. I'm very satisfied with this homework overall.
