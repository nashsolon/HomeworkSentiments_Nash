This homework is so hard that it took me a whole night to finally finish it. I feel exhausted right now. To make things even worse, I have to write this meaningful homework review
before I could go to sleep in order to gain some credits so that I don't get an F at the end of this semester. One good things is that this is the last homework. Hopefully, I don't have 
to stay entire night any more.
