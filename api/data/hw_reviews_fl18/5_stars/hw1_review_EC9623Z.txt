I like homework1 is because it gives me some space to think about data from another perspective, which is the limits of data mining. Nowadays, so many talk about big data, leading to most opinions that we can always dig something out only if we have sufficient data. However, truth is not like this, as shown in probelm 2. I teaches us that when people go creazy about big data, we should also stop for a moment and analyze problems using scientific methods, avioding focusing on only one thing blindly.
