I thought that the third homework assignment in 427 was very effective for having us look into what exactly is going on during a MapReduce and to understand the concepts more. The first problem was a nice short exercise that helped us figure out how to run a MapReduce. I really liked the second question as it helped us to more understand the reduce part of my reduce and the potential benefits and negatives for the programmer to make more or less reduce tasks.
