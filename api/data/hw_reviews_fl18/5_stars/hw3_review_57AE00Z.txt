I worked primarily on problem 2 while my partner did problem 1. I think the concept of skew is cool and incredibly relevant. Even something as simple as counting up word frequency or summing up a bunch of 1s can take DRAMATICALLY different time if there are 500 words to sum rather than 3. It was fun to think about how to deal with that problem to reduce the bottleneck. I think I understand skew and reduce() functions better now as a result of this problem.
