I'm very happy with this week's homework, it's the first time that I write codes to conduct a mapreduce program and during the process I learnt a lot about how to use toolrunner to pass parameters and execute different logic wriiten in mapper configuration. Based on what we learnt from class, I deepen my insight of mapreduce job by writing code and I this it is very helpful to write this homework as a beginning of this class and I'm looking forward to learn more from next week's classes.
