I rated homework 8 a 5/5 because it taught me the basics of Pig and Spark. I
thought there was a good mixture of written answer questions and programming
questions. The questions were well written and the problems were not confusing,
which meant that each problem didn't take very long but I could still learn
the materials needed from the problem. I was not confused for a long period of
time having to research on google to figure out how to complete a problem.
