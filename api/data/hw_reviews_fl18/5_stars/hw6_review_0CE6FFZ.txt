I like homework 6 a lot because I can build my entire map-reduce job from scratch! And what's even better is that i need to implement 2 map-reduce jobs, where the second job uses the output of the first job. This a good refresh of the major concepts and topics that we've learned in the first half of the semester so far. After finishing the second question, I have a much better understanding about the combiner, how it works and how much improvements it can generates in a map-reduce job. Overall this is an excellent homework!
