I like this homework. It is very nice. It doesn't require too much implementation. The code can be easily modified based on word-co and the slides. I made a small bug, but thant to my partner it is easily solved. I wish the rubic for problem 2 and 3 are not too harsh. These paper-pencil question can be tricky sometime. We should get the credits if we understand the material. Missing the points should be allowed.
