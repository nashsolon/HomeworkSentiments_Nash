In this homework, problem one is the easiest problem and it simply asks you to review the 5 Big Data characteristics and apply them to three instances, so it does not take a not a lot of time to complete, which is good. I think that problem two is most interesting problem because it involves challenging mathematical thinking. I personally don’t really like problem three because I don’t like reading things, but overall I would give this homework a rating of five since I like problem two so much.
