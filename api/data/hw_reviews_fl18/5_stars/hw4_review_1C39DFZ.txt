Actually it's a good assignment, it trains me the ability to use java, and I have the experience to do something meaningful, however, the instruction is kind of simple for a beginner like me, so I think it will be more friendly if more specific details can be provided. Also, I thinks improvement can be made for the reply speed in Piazza. Anyway, itâ€™s a good assignment.
