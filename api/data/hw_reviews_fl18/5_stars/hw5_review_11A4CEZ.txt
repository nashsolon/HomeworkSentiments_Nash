This homework is way better than the last one. At least that's how it makes me feel.
It still consumes me tons of time but at least I am able to always see my progress.
Knowing that fact that I would eventually make it is really important to me. Hopefully, 
we don't get to work on another homework that is as hard as last one. Just kidding, 
I want more!
