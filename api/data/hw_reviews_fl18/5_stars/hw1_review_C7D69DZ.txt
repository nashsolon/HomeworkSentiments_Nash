Overall, I thought that this was a nice homework assignment. It allowed us to directly apply what we learned in class about the characteristics of big data to three different examples, which I thought reinforced the material well. The second problem was enjoyable in the way that we applied the thought process of determining the number of evil-doers to a new puzzle. We missed one small part of our equation at first, but fixed it quickly. In general, I feel like I understand what big data is to a much greater extent.
