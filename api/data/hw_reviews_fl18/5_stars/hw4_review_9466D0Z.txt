For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lab and from textbook about using tool runner for map reduce job. 
	For problem 2, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in class about the knowledge of partitioner. 
	Through these two questions, I am not only apply the knowledge about map reduce, but also the knowledge about coding. Based on this, I grow an deep understanding about the job execution of map reduce.
