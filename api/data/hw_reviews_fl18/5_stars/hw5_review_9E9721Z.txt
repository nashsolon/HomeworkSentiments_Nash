This time the homework is much more than before. We must spend more time to deal with them. But it is good to have the experience of solving it.
The 1st problem is easy to solve, we just need to change the code from WordCount a little to do it.
The 2nd and 3rd problems is a little bit difficult but finally we finish it. 
We learn a lot from this homework
