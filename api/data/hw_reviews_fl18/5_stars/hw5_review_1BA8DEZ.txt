hw5 is a good exercise for me to finish. Problem one is fundamental to teach us how to write a relatively complete function. Problem two is about secondary sort. It guides me through the textbook and slides to read the concerning parts to get the information to finish the problem. It helps me to get the key point of global sort and secondary sort. It is a very good exercise for me.
