This homework is a good one since the arrangement is more reasonable than preivous ones. Although we struggle them for a long time as before, but we really get a lot of usful knowledge. However, i dont like the question b of problem 2 and question a of problem 3 since the corresponding context did not appear in our note and lecuture, but in the related materials and that really confused us for a while since it just jumped out and tell us you should use keyvaluetextinputformat even if we dont know what it is. i really hope the homework can be more specific match the content we learned in lecture and lab so that it helps us strength the understanding of them as this is the meaning and function of homework.
