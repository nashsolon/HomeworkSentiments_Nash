In assignment 7, we talked about communication cost, memory requrement, advantages and disadvantages of Jaccard, implementation and analysis by using cosine. What impress me is the communication cost because we will use it in a actual problem. Also, we used cosine analysis in collaborative filtering. It makes me familiar with the mapreduce flow of the algorithm. The coding part is easy but the analysis of the idea is not easy to figuer out. we deliberated and made comparsion with slides.
