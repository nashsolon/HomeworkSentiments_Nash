I was happy we get to implement what we did using our toy example in lab. Coding and debugging an implementation solidified my understating of how Top-N list work. I am also glad that we get to work with real life example. It showed me the practical application of the class. Looking at the parameter using Yarn Resource Manager was helpful in understanding the effect of a combiner.
