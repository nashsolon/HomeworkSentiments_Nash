I think homework 3 does a very good job at reviewing several confusing yet key concepts of Hadoop File Distributed System. The hints in some questions are super useful since they pointed out the specific location of the materials in the textbook that are required to solve this particular problem. This homework serves as a roadmap to the HDFS as a whole. After finishing this assignment, I feel more comfortable when exposed to these terminologies, and I have a better understanding of the abstract model of HDFS. Very good homework.
