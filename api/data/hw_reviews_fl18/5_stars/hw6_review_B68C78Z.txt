I really like this homework! It's our first time writing the code from scatch and at the beginning I thought it would be very hard, but with the previous code and the preferece provided in the git(the address is in the hw), I find I gradually get to know how to handle it and begin to understand about using hadoop to do some job. And from this homework, I get to know how to read something from yawn and I think it's interesting and useful.
