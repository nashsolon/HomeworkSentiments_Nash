In my opinion, this homework is quite interesting. The homework gave us a clear intstruction and let us know how to put what we learn from lecture into good use. Most answer could be found in lecture slides, which is a great thing for us.And the code of program was not so complex but meaningful. So I think is a guite good homework.
