Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW9 gives me alot chance to practice the spark skill and improve my understand of pyspark job running and configuration. HW9 connected to real world application, which is quite exciting to work with. And HW9 give me comprehensive understand of spark and rdd. Overall, I enjoy HW9 very well.
