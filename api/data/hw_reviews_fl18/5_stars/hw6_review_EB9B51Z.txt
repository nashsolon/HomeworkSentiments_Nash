This was a fairly decent homework. I enjoyed that I got an opportunity to code in Java for this homework, but struggled a bit when trying to figure out a suitable implementation for the combiner. When we eventually figured out that we could just use our existing reducer, we started to understand more clearly. Overall, I would say that this was a fun and informative homework assignment!
