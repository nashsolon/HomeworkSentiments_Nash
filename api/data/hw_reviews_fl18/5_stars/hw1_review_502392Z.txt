I think this was a good homework to test basic understanding of big data definitions. The examples are applicable and thought provoking. The Bonferroni’s Principle question challenged our probability and pattern recognition skills and outlined syntax that may be useful later in the course. I didn’t particularly like the reading based question but that is because I learn better from non-text sources.
