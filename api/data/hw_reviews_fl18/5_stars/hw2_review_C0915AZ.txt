I finally finished homework two today. This homework is mainly about Hadoop, HDFS, MapReduce and so on and I found them really interesting. After finishing homework 2 I learned many useful concepts and understand more thoroughly about HDFS and MapReduce. But todayâ€™s homework also spent me a lot of time to finish, and there are some words I feel a bit ambiguous but I found out there meaning eventually.
