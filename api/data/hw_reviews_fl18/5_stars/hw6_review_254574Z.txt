 liked this assignment. It's a very real-world applicable program, and I think it really helped to clarify core concepts to me. Instructions were also clearer this time than with a lot of other homeworks before. We did attempt the iterative process we talked about in class, but sometimes it just felt a lot faster to go straight to the later stages if our changes were minor.
