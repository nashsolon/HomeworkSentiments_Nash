This homework is kind of complex than previous ones, not because the amount of codes we have to write, but the logic and the examples gave to us are kind of ambiguous, which made me think it can be improved further. However, I pretty like the topic, because it's more practical for us, prividing more insights on what er can do using this MapReduce system. Finall, one suggestion for the lab is that we can incude some complete code examples and online vedio resources to make the course more strong
