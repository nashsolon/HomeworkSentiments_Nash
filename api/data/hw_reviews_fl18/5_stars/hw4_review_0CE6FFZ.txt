I really like homework 4 so far, and it is one of my favorite homework so far. Homework 4 really does a good job at reviewing the stuff I was taught in the lecture and lab. I was having a hard time understanding the materials and concepts, and after finishing this homework, I feel much better about the content. The TA's are very helpful. The coding part is easy, and it helps me to visualize the structures of the mapreduce job. I'm satisfied with this homework overall.
