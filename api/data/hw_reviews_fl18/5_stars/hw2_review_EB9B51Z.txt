I liked this homework a lot. I thought that it was fairly easy, and I enjoyed working on it with my partner. I felt that I could have been challenged a bit more by it, but I'm sure that future homeworks will afford me a difficult and stimulating intellectual experience. I am glad that I'm getting experience writing out MapReduce problems, as a strong conceptual understanding will be critical going forward with future assignments and labs. Overall, I'm happy!
