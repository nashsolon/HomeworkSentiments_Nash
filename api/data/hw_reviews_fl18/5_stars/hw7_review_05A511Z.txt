This homework is also a good one. It seems with several past homework focusing on coding, this homework starts to shift back to conceptual questions. One thing I would suggest is that because the co-occurrence recommendation is about two jobs, and we only get to implement, it would be better if we get the practice implementing both jobs (and therefore maybe the percentage of the first question should be larger).
