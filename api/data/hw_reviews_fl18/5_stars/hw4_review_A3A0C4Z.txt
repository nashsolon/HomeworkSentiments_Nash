I give this homework assignment 5 stars. Compared to the other assignments, this assignment took a much more hands on approach, in the sense that it actually made us write some code. The problems to be solved were less based in the theory of the mapreduce framework, and more based in practical application. Overall, this assignment was a good introduction to getting your hands dirty in writing mapreduce programs in java.
