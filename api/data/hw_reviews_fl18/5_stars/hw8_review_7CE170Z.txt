In homework8, we deeply discussed implementation of pig scripts. The bacis usage of FOREACH GENERATE sentence and its extension are included in the homework. Those concepts are included in pig2 slides which we need to review. Pig operations are followed by many parts, through FOREACH GENERATE is popular. Deeply understanding how does each column and head of attributes act in the FOREACH GENERATE is also important. PyPark is special one since we did add helper functions in it to help its .xml files structures and then we used its syntax to run the scripts. Finally, we discussed about pipline and its operation rules under its structures.
