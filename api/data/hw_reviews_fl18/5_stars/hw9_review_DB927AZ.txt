This homework is the most difficult homework since the start of the semester. I think the main reason is that this homework requires a solid knowledge on the commands of scala and pyspark. My partner and I spent a lot of time going through the lecture slides trying to understand this homework. We believe that through this exercise,we enhanced our understanding of the query operations.
