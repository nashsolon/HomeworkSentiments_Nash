There are 3 problems in homework 2 and I think this homework is very great! The first problem requires me to use what I learned in lab 1 and I believe it is a good chance for to review as it is always hard to remember what I did in lab homework. And there are also questions about what we learned a week ago and this is another chance for me to review. For the second and the third question, they are similar to the questions we had in class and after doing this I can understand it better.
