I liked how in this homework we got more into the theory of how these things work. I liked the last problem in part b, because it cemented my understanding of how to calculate the similarity measures. Comparing and contrasting the methods was also an interesting and enlightening exercise. I like assignments where we think about the benefits and drawbacks of certain methods.
