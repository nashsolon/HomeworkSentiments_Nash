I would give this homework a 5/5. I thought it was easier to complete than    
the previous assignment	because	I knew which resources to look at to find the
answers. I liked this homework because it helped me learn about	map reduce  
without	a huge struggle	of finding the process to complete the problem.	I also
thought	the first problem was helpful in learning HFDS.
