I thought this homework was pretty good. I had a lot of fun doing the MapReduce implementation from scratch; it was nice to exercise everything that we had learned until this point. Some of the instructions were still a little vague, but the vagueness wasn't a significant barrier, unlike previous homeworks. My only concern is that we'll be marked off for using the part-r file as the input to the second job. I hope they explain that better in the future. Overall, I had fun and learned a lot. Nice.
