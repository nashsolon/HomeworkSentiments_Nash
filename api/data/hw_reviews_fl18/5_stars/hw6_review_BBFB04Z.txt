Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW6 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR job running and configuration. HW6 gives us real world example, which is quite exciting to work with. And HW6 give me comprehensive understand of Top-N-List jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW6 very well.
