This homework is somehow easier than the other ones. In addition, this is the first coding homework using PIG, which is a very practical tool for us. Overall, I believe this is a good test of our understanding of the slides. Although I  do not think it is very hard or time consuming, my partner and I both agree that we have learned a lot from it.
