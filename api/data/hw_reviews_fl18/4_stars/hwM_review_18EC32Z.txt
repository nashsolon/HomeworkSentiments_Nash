This homework was interesting as we got to see how PageRank works on a real webgraph with many pages and links. It was good to see that our PageRank implementation produced meaningful results, in that the UC school websites were the websites with the highest PageRanks. This makes sense when thinking about the sheer size of the UC system (I believe that the system is the largest employer in the state) and the fact that those sites link to each other.
