I really like this homework because I learn a lot during the coding process. This homework is made up of 3 problems, the first problem is implementing a new program which counts the number of occurrences of each full name. This is very educative beacuse I rewrite the class of StringPairWritable and mapper and reducer, I think the most challenging part is implementing different functions including compareTo() and some other functions. The second and third problems are some Q and A about example programs.
