The HomeWork 1 is comprehensive and well designed, first question corresponding to the content of lecture 1 and help me strength the understanding of basic concepts and features of big data, although for certain characteristics i cannot give 100% ensure it's right like if the Wikipedia article is structured or semi-structred, so this makes me a little upset as there are no clear definition about which is structured that mentioned in class.
For question 2, it's well interesting and our groupd had a fun time to discuss and infer the final function, this is a good question although we think it's more likely a probability problem rather than big daya issue.
For question 3, the article is so long and professional that we totally had no idea when first browse it, the concept like Semantic Web is so new to us and we really put into a lot time to figure out what it means, also, the architacture of this article is a bit of confussed us and we cannot correspond its content with the question cleary, so like question 2 about the approach, what it refers to? the article has never clearly suggest a approach, so this really makes us upset. But after reading the article several times and search certain related info through Google to help us understanding, it tough us a lot of useful and fresh knowledge.
That's it. Thanks
