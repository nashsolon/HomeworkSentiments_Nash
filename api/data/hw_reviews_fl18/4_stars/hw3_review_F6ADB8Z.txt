This homework is pretty challenging. The answer is not so obvious to see. You have to dig into the lecture notes or the reading material to find the correct answer. Problem 1 is about running a MapReduce job. It involves resource manager Hadoop operations. Problem 2 is focus on the skewness during a MapReduce job. I find it interesting cause it's not been thoroughly talked about in class. Problem 3 is about the locality of files.
