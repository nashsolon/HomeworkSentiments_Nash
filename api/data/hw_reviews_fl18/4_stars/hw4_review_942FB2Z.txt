I found HW4 to be very enjoyable. It was nice and fun to start coding and actually apply what we learned in class. I enjoyed how this homework was connected to homework 3 regarding the sentiment values, and also kind of connects to our providing this feedback. The information in the slides were sufficient to complete the lab in a reasonable amount of time.
