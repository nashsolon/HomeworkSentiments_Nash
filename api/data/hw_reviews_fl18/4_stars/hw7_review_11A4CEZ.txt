Of course, another one. I can't say whether it's good or bad because I was unsure about lot's of problems in this homework. It took me much longer to finally finish it. Part of the reasons probably was that my teammate was not as helpful as he was last time, which was reasonable because the course are getting harder. There were some problems that I knew they were mensioned in class but could bearly remember it. Maybe I'm just too old for this. Last but not least, as always, please give me more of this so I can loss more hair.
