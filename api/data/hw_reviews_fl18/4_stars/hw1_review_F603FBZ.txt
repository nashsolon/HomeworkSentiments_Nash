I'm feeling a bit tired right now but I'm glad that I finished all the homework after all the craziness with A Capella recruitment. I guess I'm pretty excited finally go out tomorrow with Capri. We are going to go bowling and I haven't had a weekend for quite a while. Lab work is still busy, but the new team seems to be very productive and promising so I look forward to working with them. The homework was interesting and not too bad. Although reading the paper was a bit boring.
