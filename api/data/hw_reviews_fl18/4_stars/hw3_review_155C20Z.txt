This is my third homework. It mainly discusses about the running of a MapReduce job, the problem of skew and MapReduce Job using YARN. I think the first problem is quite simple, I just literally following the instructions. The second one and the third one require additional readings. The answers cannot be fully searched on the slides which gonna takes some time. 
In all, I think hw3 can have 4 stars.
