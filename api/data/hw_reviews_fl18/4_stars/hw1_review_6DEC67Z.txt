The homework was fine, but often vague. The first problem had a lot of missing information that would make answering the problems easier; while I get the utility of making us think about the ambiguities, I sorta just want to be able to answer the question with a reasonable degree of certainty.

The second problem was the most confusing. The methodology in the textbook didn't provide enough info for us to quickly arrive at a formula, so we had to tweak aspects of it over and over to get something that worked with the answer key.

	4 stars.
