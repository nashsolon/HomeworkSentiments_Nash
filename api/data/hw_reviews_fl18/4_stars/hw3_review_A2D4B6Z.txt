This was a really good homework. It was great to try my hand at actually executing a MapReduce and dseeing the output, not to mention how it almost froze and crashed my computer the first time I tried it. Learning about the practicalities of MapReduce jobs was also great, as well as being asked to think about what we can do to make it bettesr (sentiment analysis). I didn't really understand the usefulness of YARN but maybe I will through the next assignment.
