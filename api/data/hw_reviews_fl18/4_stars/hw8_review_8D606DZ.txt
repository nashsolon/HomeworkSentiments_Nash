I feel this homework is kind of too heavy. Especially we need to complete lab7 to do this one. I don't think anyone can really finish lab7 in the lab time. Maybe we can divide the homework into two part. The problems 1 to 3 are sufficient for a single homework. Although the total line of code is not mush, it does take us a lot of time to finished it. Hope the last homework could be easier.
