I think this homework is a very good one. It has both practical question and also the theorical question. And both of them is very useful and meaningful. The question is very clear and we know what to answer about. However, there are some inconsistance in the slides. For example, whether the output of reduce function should be one or two. I think we need to get informed. But, this is a very good homework.
