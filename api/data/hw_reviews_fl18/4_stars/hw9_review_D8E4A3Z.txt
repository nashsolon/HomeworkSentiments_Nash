I think this is a quite good homework. It letsus have some opportunities to hands on the spark shell. The question is clear enough and the instruction in the question is helpful. Theonlything is that we think thatthe first question of (a) and the first of (b) is the same. This should be approve. Anyway,this is a quite good exercise homework.
