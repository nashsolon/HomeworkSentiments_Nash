I think this homework assignment was pretty ok. The first problem was a good
introduction to thinking about what big data is and how it is a pretty
nebulous term, which while I suppose is reality, can be frustrating in context
of graded assignments. The second problem was fun while doing the correlative
math, but we got stuck on one little aspect which again, was frustrating, but
it wasn't major so it didn't bother me too much. And the third problem just
felt a bit tedious but it was alright.
