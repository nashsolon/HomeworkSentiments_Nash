I gave this hw a 4/5. This homeworks was different than the last two in that it was more conceptual than just coding, which is kind of nice 
as the coding can be very time consuming when you run into errors which may take a lot of googling to solve. The last problem was a bit conusing as I was not sure what they were really asking for and computing the cosine values for such sparse data is confusing. Overall it was an okay homework I just wish the directions had been a bit more clear regarding the written responses.
