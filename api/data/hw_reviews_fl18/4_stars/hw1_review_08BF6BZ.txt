All of those three problems help me a lot. Professor Neuman taught about characteristics of big data and I got to apply it in homework. This problem helps me understand professor's lecture much better. Then, problem 2 and problem 3 are figured out after reading files and paper. It cost me more than 2 hours and 3 hours to understand the reading articles respectively for problem 2 and problem 3. I hope the reading passage could be not that long. But exactly I learned a lot from it. From problem 2, I review probability and applied probability in daily life problem. From problem 3, I learned data-based approach and learned to differentiate unlabelled data and labeled data. In all, the homework is really good and helps me a lot, but I just hope the time for reading articles could be shorter.
