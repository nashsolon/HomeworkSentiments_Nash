This homework was really fun to do while remaining challenging at the same time. It was interesting to learn about how we can use different ways of sorting in conjunction with mapper and reducer tasks - it seems the crux of it is just to think about what we are doing in the mapper when we take in the input. I would like to learn more about serialization in the future and how changing the input format changed how the code works.
