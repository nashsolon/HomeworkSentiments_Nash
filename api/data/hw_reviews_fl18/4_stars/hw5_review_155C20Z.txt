This is my fifth homework. It is mainly about custom key/value pairs and secondary sort. Homework 5 is pretty challenging, just like homework 4. Meanwhile, I am not sure whether the answers are correct for a couple of questions from hw 5. i guess it's because the hint from code comment and slides is limited. And I can only be satisfied unless I figure out the correct answers. In all, I' ll give 4 stars.
