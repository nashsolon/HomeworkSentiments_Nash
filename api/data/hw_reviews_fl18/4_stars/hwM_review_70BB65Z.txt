This is the last. The final. This is the day, it ends. Finally, I am going to
finish this all out. This is the makeup homework, only for those who get
baised result in the previous homework. I have to do this to make up something
. The content of this homework, needless to comment, is not important at all.
The only thing important is that, the relief, I obtained, when I finish this.
The whole homework is a disaster. I wish I would never have to face it again.
Happily it is over. I am really happy about this.
