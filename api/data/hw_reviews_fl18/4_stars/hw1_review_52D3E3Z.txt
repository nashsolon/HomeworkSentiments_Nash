I think that homework 1 is a good start to get me familiar with the style and concept of this class. It really helps me with understanding and knowing the five characteristics of big data. Also, by completing this bonus section of the homework, I feel a little more confident with using VM. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5. Overall, I think it is a good start.
