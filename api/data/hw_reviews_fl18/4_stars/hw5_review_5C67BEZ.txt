hw5 was an ok homework. It was a bit painful at first, but it got better after I got the gist of it. I do wish that there were more instructions guiding us alone the assignment. As an example, nobody told me that the inputFormat from problem 3 was an interface of some kind. I had to read through hadoop's javadoc to understand what the question was asking. I do hope the difficulty for this class comes from actual thinking instead of ambiguity.
