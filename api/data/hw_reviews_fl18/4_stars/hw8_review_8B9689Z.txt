This homework was actually fun to do and really helpful in terms of learning pig and spark. It also helps doing the lab prior to the homework because it helps your understand the syntax easily. The part with Spark was a little challenging because I had a hard time understanding the difference between a map and a flatmap. Overall this homework seemed long but it was totally doable and easy to grasp the concept.
