This homework was fairly straight forward which tested our knowledge on the lecture material. Questions 1 in my opinion was the simplest and the easiest to finish. The article which we had to read for Question 3 was word heavy and it required me to read it 2 times to fully grasp the content. Once, I figured out what the article was talking about, it was easy to answer Question 3. Question 2 was the hardest question out of all and it was not easy. I was not happy with this question because we did not learn about the principle in question nor did we get a refresher on probability to make it easy. I had to find different lecture material to understand how the author was getting the numbers. Once I figured out how the author came up with the probabilities, it was easy to generalize it for p people and d days. I like the length of the homework and I think its perfect to have 3 questions. Any longer and I would have not liked that we had a lengthy first homework.
