I think this homework assignment was somewhat useful in my learning of Cloud Computing. The TAs did not have a good understanding of the subject matter since it was a new assignment, as I feel that it contributed significantly to my understanding of the subject matter. I think this assignment was very prone to small errors that messed up the whole code and was very time consuming. If one of the 200 iteration runs was wrong it wasted too much time to be of any help. Thank you for your consideration! I appreciate the evaluation and opportunity to gain extra credit.
