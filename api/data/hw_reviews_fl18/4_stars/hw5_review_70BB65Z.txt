This homework is still as hard as the former one. I'am so exhausted. I was
not even recovered from the last homework, and now I have to do this homework.
And in fact, the next homework is already out. This is further more frustrat
ing. Actually, I didn't finish the homework when I write this review. But the
result- what I should feel after done the homework- is already known, which
is, tired.
