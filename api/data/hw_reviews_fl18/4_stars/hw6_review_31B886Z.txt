Homework 6 is not very difficult, but it still takes me a lot of time to do it because I have lots of confusions about some conceptions. I have to check the book and slides again and again in order to understand them. And the lab5 really helps me a lot about the homework. At first I really don't know how to write the code, then the examples show me how to write them and made me work more easily!
