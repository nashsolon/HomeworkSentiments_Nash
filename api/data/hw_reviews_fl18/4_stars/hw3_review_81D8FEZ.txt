When I have done the lab2 for preparing the first question, I learned more about the process of MapReduce, and considered more about the results of this process.

The second problem is a little hard for me, I was not sure if I understand the “skew” right for this problem...

The last question helped me to review the last class’s content very well, and knew the knowledge about data locality optimization.
