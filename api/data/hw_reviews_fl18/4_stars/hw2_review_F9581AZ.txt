I was doing this homework with my partner in Duc. We were productive and efficient. I felt relaxed and motivated. We discussed and worked out the answers together quickly. I enjoyed it a lot. The weather was really nice too. Later we examined again, found some fallacies and fixed them. I feel pretty confident about this homework.
