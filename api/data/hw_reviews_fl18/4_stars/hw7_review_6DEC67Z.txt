The homework this week was fine; there were still a couple of ambiguous things, but we were able to intuit enough of them to solve everything. The last problem was probably the most challenging, because of the various technical aspects of mapreduce that we needed to take into account (the nature of group & sort, how it affects pair keys). Question 2 was definitely the most vague, but not impossible. Doable.
