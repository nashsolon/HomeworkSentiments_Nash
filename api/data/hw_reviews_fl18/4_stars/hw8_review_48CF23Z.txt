Problem 8 is the first time I work with someone else. Before, I don't want to do that because I think I would be taken points off due to my teammate's mistake. However, I found that maybe we could do our homework separately, and then check our answer and merge it into one. Due to the heavy load of homework, finally, I made this decision. I think the homework is very exhausting and time-consuming.
