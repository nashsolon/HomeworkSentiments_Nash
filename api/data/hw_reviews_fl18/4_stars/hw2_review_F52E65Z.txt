I think this homework is pretty good, each problem helps me to better understand what I have learned in the class, but the Problem 1 isn't so good, because I didn't think that our teacher ever gave us a an example about what metadata looks like, this really bothers me about how to give an answer to that problem. The other problem is very nice.
