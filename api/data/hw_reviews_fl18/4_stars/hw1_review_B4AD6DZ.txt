Overall I enjoy this homework. The first question is a bit tedious and repetitive but it is a good review and practice for the stuff we leared in the first lecture. Although the wording on that question is a bit confusing at point(like the chemical compound one). The second question I had quite some fun with it because I quite like statistic stuff so yah overall the stuff makes sense once I read about it in the text book but to be honest text book was confusing too. The last question I didn't enjoy much because the reading was so long and confusing until I read it for the 3rd time. But it is good knowledge to know.
