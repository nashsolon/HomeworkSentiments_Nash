When doing this homework, I feel slightly more confident than doing the first one, because first of all I am more familiar with the process, such as how to set up my virtual machine, where to find textbook and help, and how to submit my homework. Also, I feel like this homework really helps me understand the materials from the concept level, not just the application level.
