I think this homework was alright. It introduced us to a few new concepts that were very useful, but it was also relatively slow. I wish we could have made a custom writable class, done secondary sort, and learned how to use different input formats all in the same driver class. Sometimes the work becomes very tedious when having to create a bunch of different jobs. It helps to have some more experience, but it's never conceptually hard or interesting.
