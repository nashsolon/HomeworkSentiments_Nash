I would rate this assignment a 4/5 because it effectively taught me how to write my own map 
reduce program and helped me understand the importance of combiners. Although this homework
was better than ones in the past, I feel like the assignments could be more exciting to work. 
This one was better because I can see how I could use this in the real world and the movie 
aspect was more exciting and enjoyable to work with than previous assignments.
