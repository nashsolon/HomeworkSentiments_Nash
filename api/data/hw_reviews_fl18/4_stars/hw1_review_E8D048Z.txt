The first question directly relates to our lecture and what we discussed through the whole week. However, the second one seems difficult without enough tips and materials use for references. It took lots of time to figure out that formula. The third article is a good one except a little bit hard to summarize that approach since the content in that article is too much. I would say the first assignment is pretty fair.
