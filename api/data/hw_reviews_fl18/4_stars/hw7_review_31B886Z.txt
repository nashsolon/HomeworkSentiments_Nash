Homework7 is not too difficult for me, but it takes me a lot of time to do it. Because I have a lot of confusions about some conceptions. I check the book and slides again and again in order to understand them. I am also confused about some algorithms and I do not really understand the difference between them. It makes very difficult for me to solve problem2 and problem3. I search many books and resources on the Internet to find the answers.
