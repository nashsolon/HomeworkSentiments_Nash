I thought homework 2 was a little better than homework 1 because the last 2 questions didn't require much writing but mostly just an understanding of how MapReduce works. I still don't like the questions that are more qualitative and require more reading (in this case question 1). Although it helps me reread the text, I found myself copying the words from the reading without completely understanding the concepts.
