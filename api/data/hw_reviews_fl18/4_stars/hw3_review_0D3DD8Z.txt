This homework was pretty fun. I liked that it used lab2's results to answer problem 1. It was really cool to see how much the words 'the' and 'love' were used in shakespeare's works. 2 and 3 were also pretty good because I learned a lot about MapReduce and had to think a lot about the optimization of mapreduce tasks in the future. Overall, pretty good problem set, would do again.
