today's homework was ok; it was good to work on the SPARK syntax and learn some more about how it runs. I think working in the shell was a little rough and confusing; from what I can gleam it doesn't seem that most people use the shell to run code through SPARK. Otherwise, it wasn't too bad getting the code to execute and answering the questions. Rating: 4
