This homework was pretty painless. I didn't really enjoy the first problem, since it took a lot of reading and sometimes felt a bit unclear what exactly it was asking/looking for. The MapReduce problems were pretty simple. I'm not completely confident that I did them correctly, but if I did, then they definitely weren't super intensive. Really, this homework didn't take very long, especially compared to some other classes, so I really can't be mad about it.
