The homework has moderate amount of work to be done. The first question is
qualitative, and you just write some of your thoughts. This is done by my 
friend and me, which costs around 30 minutes. The next question is a little
bit hard, mainly duo to its unclear statement of the question. I tested
all cases that is possible according to the problem's description, and 
finally find the answer. It costs more than 2 hours. The last question is to
read an paper and answer the question. Honestly I didn't read that paper,
my friend done this part. Doing second question costs me too much.
