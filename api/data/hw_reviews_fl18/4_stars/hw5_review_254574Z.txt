I did not like this as much as other assignments. Generally I just felt that, especially for problem two, the instructions were just very unclear, making it difficult to know what was actually being asked of us. It does tickle me that the way to return oldest first is to remove a line of configuration and just use the default though. Problem 3 was also unclearly instructed, but I think our final product looks fun.
