This homework was pretty good, but I think it will really depend on how it is graded. The first question is quite open ended and I hope that it is graded on the justifications rather than simple yes or no answers. It is nice that this focused on important high level concepts that will help students identify problems in the real world that the methods of the class can be applied to.
