Homework 5 was not my favorite homework but I understand the value of it. The homework helped as I better understand how to make a quality mapreduce program and how to integrate partitioners and toolrunners with it. The first problem of the homework and how we were using StringPairWritable with the rest of the program was a bit confusing and I would have liked the directions to be a bit more clear. The secondary sort was also a bit confusing but I liked it a bit more because it made you think more about what is actually going on behind a mapreduce program and it made us change the program a little bit to accomplish a different goal that was originally intended when the program was made. Overall I think the homework was a good learning experience but wish the directions were a bit more clear.
