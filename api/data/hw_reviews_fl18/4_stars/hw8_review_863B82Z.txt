I felt that this homework was very informative. I liked that it was broken up into a larger distribution of consumable questions. This setup allows for the large breadth of information to be gone over. I feel that this homework set could have also been suplemented with more thought experiment questions. Overall, I still that that this homework set was very beneficial
