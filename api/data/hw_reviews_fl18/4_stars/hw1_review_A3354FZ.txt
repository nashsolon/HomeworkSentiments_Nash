HW1 Extra problem

(1) First problem is really good review for learning lecture notes. I am really enjoy this problem, we can get a deep learning  of the properties of data and use the practice to consolidate what I have learned.

(2) for problem 2, a little bit confused about the question. I have searched from google to help me understand what it want me to do. 

(3) too much reading, more learning of data, not bad
