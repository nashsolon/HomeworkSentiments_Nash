Overall I found question 1 to be kind of confusing since it was kind of vague. Other than that it was a decent set of questions. I enjoyed question 2. Question 3 seemed to not be as informative as questions 1 and 2. The lengths of the questions were reasonable as well, question 1 just took a bit longer since it was a bit more vague.
