homework 5 so far is most time consuming homework among all the 427s assignments so far. I will rate this homework as neutral since some of the questions are somewhat ambiguous. But the coding part is fun and challenging. Although it took me a long time to actually figure out how the secondary sort works, I've benefit a lot from it. There are definitely space for improvements, but overall this homework is ok.
