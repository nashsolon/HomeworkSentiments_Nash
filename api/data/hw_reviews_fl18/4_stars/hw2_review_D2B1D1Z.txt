In my opinion, homework 2 is much more difficult than the first one. But is more interesting either. It is hard to find answers for problem 1 in the text book. So I am not sure whether my answers are correct, which makes me anxious. Problem 2 and problem 3 are easier. The process of answering the questions was a good way to review the DFS. Drawing a sketch in Wrod is complex.
