:This homework is not so difficult for me. Most answers of problems can e found in lecture slides or text book. But some questions are troublesome. Although I know that the solutions are right there in the book. I need to read the materials carefully and make a summary. The problem 1 is awesome. Because it let me excute the map reduce program by myself so that I can get a deep impressiion on how it works. By searching specific words in the output file, I got a chance to learn about what does the result look like. I think it is really cool
