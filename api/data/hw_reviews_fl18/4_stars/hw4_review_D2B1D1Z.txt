This homework is kind of difficult for me. Writing codes for problem 1 and problem 2 sometimes makes me anxious, especially when there were some bugs in the program but I can not find them. That feels terrible. But once I finished the job and everything were all set, the feel change immediately. I felt proud of myself because I can finish such a hard work. In a word, the process is tough but the result is awesome. So I do love this homework.
