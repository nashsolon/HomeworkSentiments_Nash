I enjoyed the second homework assignment as I thought we are starting to get into the meat of the material and actually being able to do stuff. This one was a bit more difficult as we had to diagram and think about the process of how a distributed file system works and we had to look at the benefits and negatives of both. I think everything that was done in this assignment was pretty beneficial towards learning the material of the class, but I do wish we had gone a bit further with the tasks.
