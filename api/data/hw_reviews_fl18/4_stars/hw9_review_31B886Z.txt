Homework9 is really difficult for me. We change our language pig to python, but we do not have eclipse help us to debug. It takes a lot time to adopt a new gammar and write new language. Also, spark is a new platform. In this case, it is not easy for me to figure out how the principles. However, my teammate and I become more familar with those new languages after finishing the homework9.
