I feel like this homework is also pretty straightforward. It combines both SPARK and PIG, which we had plenty of time to test around with during the previous labs and quizzes. Therefore, it does not feel like a very challenging homework. Also, the first three PIG problems are kind of similar, once you understand one, the others become realtively easy. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5.
