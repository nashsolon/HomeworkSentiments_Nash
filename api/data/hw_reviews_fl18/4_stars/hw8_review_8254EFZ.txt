I liked that we had a lot of chances to practice both pig and spark. But the amount? Seriously? This was A LOT. I feel like we really could have used some more practice. Just compare it to the amount of practice we had with Java implemented MapReduce... Both pig and spark are much more powerful than Java-Hadoop MapReduce, but we only got to practice it once, during class(!), before this lengthy homework.
