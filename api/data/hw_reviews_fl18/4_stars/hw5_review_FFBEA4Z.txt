I enjoyed homework 5 because I found it interesting, although it took me a substantial period of time to complete because it was more work than some previous assignments.  I also found the instructions to be unclear in some places and they had to be explained to me by a ta.  For example, when unzipping the data, it would not be formatted properly unless I unzipped the data on my local machine and then transferred it, but I didn't think this was made clear in the instructions.  Overall, though, I feel that it enhanced my understanding of the concepts.
