I liked the first questions because I had to use knowledge that I learned in class. I did        
not like the 2nd question because we had never talked about probabilities in the class and there
were no	resources to help students to understand the question. The third question was okay since 
it required us to read an article where we could figure out the answer ourselves. Overall, I think
the homework was of standard difficulty	for being the first assignment.
