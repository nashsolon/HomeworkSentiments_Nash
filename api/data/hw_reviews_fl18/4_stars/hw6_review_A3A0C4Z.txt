I gave this homework assignment a rating of 4 stars. I thought it was a good introduction to getting us to write a MapReduce job entirely from scratch. Also the second part was a good way of getting us to see some statistics as to how our jobs are actually running. For example, the job looks the same when run with or without a combiner, but under the hood, the combiner is actually making a large difference as to how efficiently the job is running. Overall this was a good homework assignment.
