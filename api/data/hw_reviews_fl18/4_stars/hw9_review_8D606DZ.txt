This homework is not bad. As the semester goes, I feel the homework becomes easier, as the professor have predicted. Most of the code are simple modification of the slide. The only problem is the dependent on the lab. Some labs are too much and impossible to finish in the lab time. Overall it is an ok homework. I am also kind of worry about question 3, since it contains a lot of information that is not in the slides.
