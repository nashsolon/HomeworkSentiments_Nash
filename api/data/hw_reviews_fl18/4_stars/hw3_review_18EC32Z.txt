I thought that this homework was fairly straightforward. Like the previous homeworks, it allowed us to reinforce ideas we learned in lab and lecture such as YARN scheduling and MapReduce. Additionally, we got to explore HDFS outputs in more depth, which allows for some practical experience. I also thought that skew part was interesting even though we may not have discussed it in class.
