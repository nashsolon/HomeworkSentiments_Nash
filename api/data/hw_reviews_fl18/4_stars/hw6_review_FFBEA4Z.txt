This homework was pretty good, because I prefer implementation questions to conceptual questions.  Overall, the workload was reasonable and the material was interesting.  Unfortunately, the instructions for problem 2b were unclear and confusing.  Besides that, the lab was pretty intuitive although it was difficult to debug.  I also thought the combiner counter comparison was interesting and helpful, because it allowed me to see what the combiner was actually doing.
