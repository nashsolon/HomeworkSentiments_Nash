I think this homewok 5 is a very helpful one. It has many coding practise, which really helps me understanding the concept of the mapreduce function, especially the question of global sorting. This realy teach me a lot. However, there are some describtion that is not clear enough, fir example, the key distribution in question 2. I have never heard this term before, so I think it is better to provide some link to the term if we are not familiar with it. Anyway, it is an excellent homework for me.
