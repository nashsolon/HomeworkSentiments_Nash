I thought that this homework wasn't that hard in terms of the diffculty of the individual questions. The time that it took was not too hard either because there was not one section that really sucked a lot of time. However, I did feel like the answers to some of these questions could be construed as a bit subjective because some of it could rely on people's interpretation of certain questions. I am looking forward to homework's were there is more of a certainty when it comes to the answers.
