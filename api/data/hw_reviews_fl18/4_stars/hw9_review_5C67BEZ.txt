Homework 9 was not very hard. I thought we were going to implement a page rank in this homework, but we were just asked 2 questions about it. I like using spark but I found it difficult to write python in non-python-specific editors as I couldn't see how many tabs there are in a line. Also, I did find problem 3 a bit confusing as we didn't really learn about any of the configures in class. So I couldn't be sure if I was correct.
