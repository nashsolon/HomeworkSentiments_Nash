The hw is rather interesting and this bonus is even more. However, besides commenting on the homework, I would also like to add some difficulties to this sentimental analysis task. And you'll see. The task for each of the question could be clearer, sometimes I will be lost in the words and have a har time figuring out what should I do or perform to answer the question. Overall, I truly believe it is a great exercise after each classsssss. And really learnt a lot after completion. Andaswell, thanksforoffering this opp to hearour voice!
