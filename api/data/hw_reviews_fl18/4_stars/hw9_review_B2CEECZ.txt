For problem 1, we loaded, filtered and displayed the web server logs in a formatted way.
For problem 2, we explored the Loudacre web server log files using key-value Pair RDDs.
For problem 3, we wrote a simple SPARK program in Python or Scala that counts the number of JPG requests in the web log data. 
For problem 4, we investigated the data representation of the web graph used in the PageRank algorithm.
