I liked this homework. Problem 1 had good questions that required some thinking about the HDFS, and problems 2 and 3 were great pen and pencil problems that made me think about the structure of the outputs, while still being simple and straightforward. I appreciated how we were asked to list the inputs and outputs of both the mapper and reducer seperately, because that made me think about how they are structured.
