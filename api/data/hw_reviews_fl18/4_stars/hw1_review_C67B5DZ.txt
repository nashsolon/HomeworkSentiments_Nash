The homewrok relates to the knowledge introduced in class well, especially the first problem. But some other problems are not so organized. For example, when dealing with the second problem I figured out a result that is correct only with the first group of data(p=2,d=2). So I googled this question and found that this question is an example of Bonfon Lonnie principle. And I found that my result is just the same with that. So I am confused whether my answer is correct or not. And I think some more statements should be added at the end of this problem to tell us why we are doing such a culculation like "analysis based on limited restrain is meaningless" or so. Just my own perspective.
