For this homework, the understanding part takes over the majority instead of the coding part. I think this may because the collabrative filtering problem is relatively big and can be hard for a homework. So, without coding, the other part of this homework is pretty easy. Basically everything you need to put down on your writeup can be found on lecture notes or on books.
