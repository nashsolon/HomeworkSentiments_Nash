This homework i would say is a big hands on expereince and refered back to the previous labs alot for helps with hadoop. I really liked it and i think it helps a lot building up the understanding. however i think the instructions should contain more information or guidence or help so when we are doing the labs and homework we will get more idea of why some results is happening, or we can troubleshoot with more insights and likelihood to identify the problem ourself. other than what i just mentioned, i also think that the homework is a bit too long.
