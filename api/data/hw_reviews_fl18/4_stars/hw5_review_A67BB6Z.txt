This homework took the longest time of all homeworks assigned yet, but it was very helpful in a way that we had to consider the entire workflow of mapreduce, being careful of each input and output types, and implement secondary sort. While I could find all necessary information about the homework material from the slides, it could have been better if the instructor provided us with more information about Globally Sorting the output without using TotalOrderPartitioner.
