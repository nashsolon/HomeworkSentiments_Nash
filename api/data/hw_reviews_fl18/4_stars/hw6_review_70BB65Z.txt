This homework, in total, is easier than the formal two. One reason is that th
ere is a very good example provided. Though I can't understand some of the cod
ings.. Another reason is that I start this homework very early.(maybe not) Th
is makes me not to hasted. all in all, I need to write up some thought, and ma
ybe that is, not bad.
