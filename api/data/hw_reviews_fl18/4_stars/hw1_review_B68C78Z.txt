There are 3 problems in homework 1 and I think the first one is very great because it requires me to use what I have learned in class and analyze them in depth. The second problem is also interesting and I can learn something from it. The last problem is very hard for me because it is not an easy task to understand the whole essay and I also spend much time figuring out what the questions mean and what are the corresponding answers.
