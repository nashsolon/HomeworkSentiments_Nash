This is my sixth homework. It is mainly about making a Top N list. I need to write two jobs which is quite challenging, but I get some hints from github referenced in the lab instruction. I came across some problems when debugging locally using Eclipse and it was much easier to solve the problems. However, when submitting the job to Hadoop, I encountering new problems which was quite challenging. I will rate this hw6 a 4 stars.
