I think this homework was very thorough. To answer the questions it took reviewing the information learned in lecture and ensuring that you understood it. It was a good mix of of simple understanding/recounting and more complicated analysis of the concepts in these lectures. I think this was a reasonablehw assignment and was relatively enjoyable.
