Initially I thought this homework will be a relatively easy homework,because most of the code are already given in the example (from github). However, when implementing it, we found the homework be more difficult than we expected. Because we are using someone else's code, we have to make sure we understand everything he wrote and then continue. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5.
