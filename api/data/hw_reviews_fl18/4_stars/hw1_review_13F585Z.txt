I really enjoyed problems 1 and 3 on this homework. Problem 1 gave me a great amount of practice on the characteristics of big data sets. Problem 3 gave me incredible insight on the effectiveness of unlabeled data. Problem 2 on the other hand was a pain becuase I didn't figure out the formula until I had put a significant amount of time into the homework.

4/5 stars
