I gave this homework a rating of 4 stars. I thought it was a step in the right direction in terms of having the homeworks be more application oriented. Since there was a lot of code-based problems, we really got our hands dirty and solved realistic problems. Also the notion of the tasks in the lab being for made-up companies is a good way to stress how useful the techniques/technologies we are learning can be in the real world. One problem with the lab was that the steps describing the logic of our scripts was vague and a bit unclear.
