The first homework is mainly a review of the things taught in the first week, I think it is a good way for us to review some knowledge and view some extra materials.
However, some questions in the hw actually I cannot find a good answer, such as the structure of the data. Also, the vmware is a troublesome thing for me at all. I spent a  lot of time on it and util now, it is still so uncomfortable for me. If we can complete our homework without it, it would be better for me.
