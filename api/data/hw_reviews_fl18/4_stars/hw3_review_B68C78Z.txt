I really like the first question in hw3! From it, I can see that the code can be put into practical use. When trying to process the wordCount function and seeing what’s going on in HDFS, I get to know more about what we learned in class. When it comes to problem 2, I get to know a new thing — skew and by reading the book and PPT, I learned the detail of it and as we are required to analyze 3 situations in this problem. I found that when I read the book for the first time, I didn’t understand it thoroughly and as a result I read it again. For the last problem, I think It’s another kind of review of the class and it’s interesting.
