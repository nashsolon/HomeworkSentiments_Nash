I thought this assignment was very helpful to learn and understand collaborative
filtering using map reduce. The questions asked seemed helpful as possible 
study questions for the test and all of the answers could be found in the 
resources in this class. I gave this assignment a 4/5 because I thought it was
taught me a lot but I wish the assignments were a little more interesting.
