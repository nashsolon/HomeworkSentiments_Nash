This homework, as frustrating as it was, definitely taught me a lot about the basics of Hadoop MapReduce. I found myself consulting the textbooks and lecture slides quite a bit, and though it was work to flip around different sources to find the answers I was looking for, it forced me to learn the material much more deeply that I may have otherwise. In the future, I might prefer more problem-oriented problems, rather than open-ended conceptual problems, but that's just a personal preference.
