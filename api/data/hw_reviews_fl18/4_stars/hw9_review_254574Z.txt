This homework was fine. I like spark; it's pretty intuitive. It was annoying when transformations were taking forever such as join, but I suppose that's a good lesson in preprocessing data to be efficient. What I really didn't like however was that we tried to go to TA hours on Friday and there were no TAs; that's very unprofessional. Also, there were a lot of repeat questions and questions with incorrect information, which was a pain to figure out on our own.
