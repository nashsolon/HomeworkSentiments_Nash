First of all, I think Problem 1 helps us to review the fundamental knowledge of big data characteristics, I need to check the definitions of them and think over does it have these characteristics and why, so it really helps me deepen my impression on it.

What’s more, I checked the mentioned book of the second problem on the internet and find the original problem, which helps me know more about this problem and the meaning of it. 

Finally, the article that you recommended us to read related to big data, I found the data-based approach in it, known the limit of this approach and other example of “n-gram”. It broadens my horizon~ But I am from another country it is a little hard for me to understand them all, so thank you for giving the chance to practice my English reading ability, too~

Thank you!
