In this homework. I completed three parts. In the first part, I ran the code and got the results for the homework. Which is great! On the second part, I answered three question about the phonomenon of skew. And I explained some methods to reduce the skew by probability and statistics knowledge. Among this home work, I got more familiar with the process of MapReduce and the master controller. I got more familiar with the philosophy of the process, like how does it work, and what is the benefit doing so?
