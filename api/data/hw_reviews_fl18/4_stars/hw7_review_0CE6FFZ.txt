for homework 7, I think it is a good practice for me to have a better understanding of the bit tough materials that was covered during the lecture. I rated above average since I think some of the questions are meaningful yet challenging. Question 1 covers the co-occurrence problem, and I'm having fun doing this question. I like question 2 the best since it is a good refresh for me to understand the relationships between different similarity function. Question 3 is also a good practice of knowing how the collaborative filtering actually works. Overall I rate this homework above average.
