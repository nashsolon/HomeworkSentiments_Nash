This homework is a good one. The second and third problem are highly related to lab2 and help us review the content of map reduce. And also the first question reviews the definition of HDFS. However, I personally think the (f) in question 1 is a bad one since there's no reference and resource about the process of how the data is located and transferred. I figured out by asking TA.
