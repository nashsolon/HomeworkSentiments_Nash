I feel like this is one of the homework that feels most useful to me. It is like the whole homework really challenges on how well I understand the command works for each of them and I feel like this is really good. Although I don't really like the spark part because I feel like the knowledge got from lecture and lab on these things still feel sreally vague. But overall I think its pretty good.
