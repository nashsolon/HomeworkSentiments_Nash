This homework has a relatively larger proportion related to the theoretical / concept intuition compared with implementaiton. I like this structure because it forces us to be conceptually familiar with the code we are implementing and the purpose behind it instead of just copying over the code syntax. I'm in a genrally good sentiment right now. I am excited to learn more about materials related to the recommendation system in the future
