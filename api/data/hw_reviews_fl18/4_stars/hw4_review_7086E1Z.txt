The fourth homework is about setting up job configuration through command line by using ToolRunner, and implementing customized Partitioner. Unlike former homework, this one is more practical and allow me to write the code myself to implement all the stuff. Throughout this homework, I successfully made a prototype of sentiment analysis which is very inspiring. It is about using the knowledge I learned from course in to practice. Through this practice, I learned many more about job configuration in ToolRunner and Partitioner.
