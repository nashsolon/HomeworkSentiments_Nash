This homework was good; better than the last one. I got to solidfying my technical understanding of mapreduce without having to deal with the ambiguity of the last homework. It was good to figure out exactly how each input would be processed and stored. With large enough scale, I can understand how this process can be pretty powerful. In all, not too bad. Didn't take too long, either. Hooray!
