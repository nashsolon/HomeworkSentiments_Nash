I liked the problems in homework 5. I had fun thinking about how the partitioner could work to do a global sort, and why the output is not by default sorted globally. I like that these problems have real-world applications, like for this one to be able to quickly and efficienty pull out the oldest or youngest person from a list of names. One thing that confused me is why we would want the youngest person by last name, and not full name. Oh well, it's ok for me to disagree since that's a pretty easy fix.
