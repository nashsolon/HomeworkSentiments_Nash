I thought that this homework was more challenging than the previous three homeworks because we had to implement our own MapReduce this time. We had to go to TA hours this time to get clarification on some of the instructions, which I thought were a bit vague. The part about the Distributed Cache in problem #2 was a little hard to grasp. But because we struggled a little more in this assignment, I feel like I learned a lot.
