This homework is pretty interesting in my opinion. I thought it has a good balance of understanding the theory  or concept and using the material in actual problems. Implementing the material is still, in my opinion, easier than understanding the concepts. Once I understand the concept, it is not as bad to implement everything. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5.
