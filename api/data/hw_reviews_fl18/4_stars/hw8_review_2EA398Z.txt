Overall I think the this week's assignment is very practical and help me to get familiar with the pig and spark. It is not that difficult as before but it requires to have a good command of the syntax. And syntax is the issue that i spent most of the time on the homework. So, I strongly recommend that we need to first have a good knowledge and practice in syntax, then we begin to create projects.
