This homework was fun, except when I was trying to figure out the "Implement a Partitioner using the stubs SentimentPartitioner.java provided in your SVN repository" part. I initially thought I had to edit the Partitioner in the native folder, and incorporate into job execution (somehow) using the Distributed Cache. I had to do a LOT of research in order to confirm my skepticism, and indeed make a new Java class object within the src. Perhaps the instructinos could have been clearer, but I generally, it was fun and practical.
