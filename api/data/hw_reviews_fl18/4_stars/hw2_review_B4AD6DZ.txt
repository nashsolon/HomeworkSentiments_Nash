I feel like this homework is already starting to get more complicated than the first homework. I quite enjoy it though because I like the puzzle solving feeling from these questions, also the difficulty is not that high. I do not like some of the wording though. For example, problem 3, at first I was very confuse what does it mean by file type, like as in jpg or html, or the common/ catalog thing because they both make some sense.
