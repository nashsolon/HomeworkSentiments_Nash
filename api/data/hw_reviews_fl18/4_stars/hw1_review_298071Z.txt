I found this homework interesting in that I think it was a good introduction into big data. I found the 2nd problem difficult, mostly because my probability skills are weak, but ultimately made sense of it, and I feel it highlights and important topic. I found the reading for 3 to be interesting because It's kind of magical just howpowerful massive sets of data can be in prediction. Overall I think it was an insightful homework
