Overall, I would rate this homework 4 points out of 5. The second problem is 
my favorite one. Although it took me a while to figure it out, it was fun to 
finally got my formula matches with the given table. I think I would prefer 
problems that have deterministic solutions rather than those open solution 
ones such as problem one and three. But I understand this type of question is 
needed.
