This week's homework is very intersting because we exercise a lot of spark program execution and implementation. From this week's homework I reviewed what I have learned from previous lectures and know how to do a mapreduce job using spark. Moreover, after exercising with the first two problems in this homework, I became more proficient in transforming data and do some specific actions based on it. It's quite challenging to implement problem 2e.
