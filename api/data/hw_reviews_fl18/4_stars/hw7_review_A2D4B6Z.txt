Using this homework i was able to see the relative simplicity of using the pairs approach to finding cooccurrences of words. I don't think it would be this simple to implement a stripes approach, and I would think that it wouldn't really be worth the effort when it comes to looking at Shakespeare's words. I'm guessing that this will be our last homework in Java and while it was really annoying testing our code using Java it was a good way to learn how everything works.
