I enjoyed problem 1 and found it incredibly helpful. I thought it gave me great experience and lots of examples to consider how the characteristics applied to each big dataset. 

Problem 2 was challenging to get the math correct.

I thought the article for problem 3 was interesting and relevant. 

Overall, this homework assignment took an appropriate amount of time (~3.5 hours in total) and I was glad I got to work with a partner. I found it beneficial to discuss my opinions with another person.
