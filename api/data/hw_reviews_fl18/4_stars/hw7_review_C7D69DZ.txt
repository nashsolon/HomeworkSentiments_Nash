I thought that this was a fine homework assignment. I thought that part 1 was interesting where we had to implement the word co-occurence. I thought that this part wasn't too bad to implement and I liked seeing the different pairings of words within the shakespeare data. I found the pairs vs. stripes distinction for this particular application harder to grasp, but feel like I understand it better now. For the very last part where we did an item-item approach on the movies I thought that the calculated cosine similarities weren't very helpful because there wasn't enough data.
