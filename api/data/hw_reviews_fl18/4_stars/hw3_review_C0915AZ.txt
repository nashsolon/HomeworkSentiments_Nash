Homework three took me a lot of time to finish, and probably it took the longest time comparing to former ones. The reason I think is that there are a lot of things I need to discover from textbook or website like YARN, sentimental analysis, and completely understand them needs a lot of time. But still I think it really worth it because I learned a lot.
