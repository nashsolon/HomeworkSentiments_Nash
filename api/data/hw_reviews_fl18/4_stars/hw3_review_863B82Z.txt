This assignment was pretty long and required a lot backtracking through previous slides and book material. I also feel that the information covered was very useful in understanding how the Hadoop infrastructure works. Overall, while I still feel like a more hands-on homework assignment would have been more interesting, this homework assignment still covered fairly interesting and useful subjects. I feel like it is a bit hard to verify whether or not any given answer is correct for this set of questions.
