There are 2 preparations to do in this homework. In my opinion, I understood what their purpose and function are only after finishing the whole problem. I would prefer given some instruction on how to modify the file myself and with some explaination about them. Instead of given a completed file and run it directly without understanding its content. So my suggestion is that more comment is needed for these parts.
