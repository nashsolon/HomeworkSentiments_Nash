This homework was especially helpful in that it helps us practice implementing mapreduce, with driver class method, toolrunner method, and distributed cache method. However, this homework was a lot of work, and took much longer than usual. Also, for the sentiment partitioner portion of the homework, I feel like there were some errors in the pre-defined codes and there wasn't much instruction on what the methods of Partitioner was for.
