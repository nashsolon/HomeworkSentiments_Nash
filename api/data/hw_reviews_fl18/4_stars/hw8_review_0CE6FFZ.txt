By far homework 8 is the most challenging homework. I will rate this homework as awesome because it covers almost all the materials we've discussed in the lecture and lab, and what's more is that it provides practical exercises to interact with pig and spark. After finishing the homework, I have a better and deeper understanding of pig and spark, about their advantages and disadvantages. Homework 8 is hard, but the slides and lab instructions are very helpful, so while the work is time-consuming, i will rate this homework as great.
