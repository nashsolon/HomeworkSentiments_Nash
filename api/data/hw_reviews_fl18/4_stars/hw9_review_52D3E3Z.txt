I would give this homework a four out of five, because I think this homework is a good practice and review before the exam. Even though it requires some extra research to find the correct functions to use, it is still pretty straightforward and easy to understand. I did, however, find this homework confusing because part of problem 1 seems to be a overlap with part of problem 2 - I do not quite understand the meaning of designing the homework this way.
