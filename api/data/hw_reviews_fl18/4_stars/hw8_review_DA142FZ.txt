I pretty like this time's homework. The assignment tested us skills with Pig. And with the application of the PIG, we use it to find out key words of high values and sites with low costs. We uses PIG to manage our database locally and we do not need to write Java code. Also managing the local data base is easier than the distributed file system, because the ditributed file system is not mutable in the usual case.
