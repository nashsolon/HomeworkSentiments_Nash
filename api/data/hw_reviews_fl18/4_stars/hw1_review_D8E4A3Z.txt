There are totally three question in this homework. I think the first and second question is straight forward. Especially the second question, it strength my understanding of that problem. However, I speand a lot of time on the third problem, not only reading the article, but finding the answer in the articel. Ithink that the question is not clear enough, especially question b and c. The article has talked about many problems based on data set and I am not sure which one to describe and talk about the problem. I think the question should be more clearin next homework.
