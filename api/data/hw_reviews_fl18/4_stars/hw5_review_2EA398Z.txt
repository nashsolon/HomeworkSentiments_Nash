Homework for homework 5 is more about the practice than the theory, which is great to me. But on the other hand, it will takes me more time to figure out the overall logic and make the MapReduce jobs running. It is challenge though, yet interesting. If we could have some examples for the codes, rather than giving a general solution, I think it could help us to understand the codes and the job more concretely.
