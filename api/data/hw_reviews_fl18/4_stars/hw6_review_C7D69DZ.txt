I thought that this homework assignment was fine. It was interesting to use a real-life sample of data in the first section when we found the top N most popular movies from the Netflix data. It was cool to see movies that I recognized as popular movies show up as the most popular ones from the MapReduce job. I learned a lot more about combiners in the second part of the homework assignment, which I thought was useful.
