Personally I think this homework is quite difficult. My confidence level is probability a three out of five. We realized that even though we understand the concept or the theory, when we need to actually implement it, there are a lot more details going into the implementation, and it is not as easy as we thought it would be. That is what makes the homework more difficult or challenging than we thought.
