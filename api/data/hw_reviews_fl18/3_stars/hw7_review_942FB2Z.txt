HW7 was fun. I really enjoyed the implementation part of the lab for part A, and the follow-up questions really forced me to go back to the lab we did and truly understand it. I really appreciate that we got to do lab 6 in class; otherwise, I definitely would have been more unsure about my approach. The similarity measure questions were nice, but I definitely found out while answering them that I needed to deepen my understanding, and they helped me think each similarity measure through.
