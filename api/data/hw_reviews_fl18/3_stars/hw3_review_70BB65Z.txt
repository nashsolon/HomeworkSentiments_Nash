This homework was a lot more harder than the former two. The main problem
is that we have to do the lab2 before doing this homework. However, we got
only 30 minutes to do lab2 on the lab hour. So I only did a little, and
am not sure what is going on. As of today, I want to do hw3, but lab2 is 
not done, and in lab3 on Tuesday I basicaly did nothing.. THis is really my 
fault. I did this hw painfully. After done it, I think I learnt something
decent.
