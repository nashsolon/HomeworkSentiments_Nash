The first problem on hw3 related highly on lab2 and it is about word count example. I feel part a and b are easy but I am not good at explain things so c, d, and e is hard for me. Problem 2 is the hardest problem in hw3 from my point of view because we did not cover a lot about this topic in class so most information is from textbook. Problem 3 is fine to me since its major part is covered in one lecture PPT.
