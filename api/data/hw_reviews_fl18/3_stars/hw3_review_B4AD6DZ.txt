This one start to involve actual coding into the homework. I would say it makes it a lot more difficult than the previous assignment. I do not really like this one because the question’s are a lot more difficult to find. Like the last few question in problem 2 and problem 3. It took me so long just trying to find the answer from the text book and a lot of time I even double check with google. If most problem, doesn’t even have to be each question, can have a hint that points to the pages that contain the stuff for the answer it can be so much better.
