I gave this homework a 3/5 because the directions were unclear. I think it has potential in being a more like a 4/5 homework because I enjoyed actually implementing mapreduce programs and lookn more into the configurations of the driver, but some of the questions were unclear and many questions were not answered on piazza or even any hints given which made for a lot a bit of confusion. Also there was a typo in which file to use until about Wednesday for problem 1 which is why I started so late.
