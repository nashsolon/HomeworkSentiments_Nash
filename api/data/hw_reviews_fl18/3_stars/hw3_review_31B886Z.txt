I think homework3 is good. It includes Lab2 ans some contexts in class. If homework2 also contains some informations about how to use some of the codes or how to realize some functions, it will be much better! I also like the question3 because I need to review some knowledge about hadoop mapreduce job execution and data locality optimization and it will benefit my next class studying.
