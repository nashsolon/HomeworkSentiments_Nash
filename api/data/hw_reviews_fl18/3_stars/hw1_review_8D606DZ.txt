The homework 1 is a good introduction for big data, it helps us understand how the definition and characteristics of big data. But I feel this HW is too much verbal / less defined. I would expect more concrete mathy problem instead of reading problem. Especially I feel the problem 3(c) is not well-posed. The article does not really talk about the limit of statistic approach. In general it is a good homework.
