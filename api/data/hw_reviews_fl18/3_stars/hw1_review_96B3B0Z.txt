Overall, I enjoyed this homework although my 240 skills were a little rusty so problem number #2 gave me a little bit of PTSD. I thought the article we had to read for #3 was very interesting, so I enjoyed that problem thoroughly. For problem 1 it was good to see examples of different types and styles of big data sets, and really put into context what it meant to be complex which I was confused about from lecture.
