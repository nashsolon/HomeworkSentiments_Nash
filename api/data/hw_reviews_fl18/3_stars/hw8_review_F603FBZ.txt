This homework took a long time to debug. But overall it isn't too bad. PIG and SPARK are both much easier to work with and faster to debug with local files. I can see how these are better adapted tools for big data parsing and analysis.However, the stub files given have a lot of bugs and typos that are not consistent with the homeework instructions which makes the debug annoying.
