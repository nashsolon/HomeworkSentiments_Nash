This homework was decent, although was a little too conceptually easy. The concepts were things that we had already been over a lot and we didn't really explore them further, but rather just implemented them again and looked at them on a higher scale. I would have liked more questions like asking problem 2 part b, asking about the checkpointing and why it was done. I would have liked it if this furthered our understanding about the problems themselves or about best practices/design decisions in hadoop.
