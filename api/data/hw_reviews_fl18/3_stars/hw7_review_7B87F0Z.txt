Star Rating: 3

Mid on this homework. We kind of rushed through it and I didn't do the readings as thoroughly as I normally like to due to a midterm in another class on Tuesday. Only read enough to get the required info. I'll definitely be revisting this content because it's inherently interesting stuff. Looking forward to more business intelligence-related stuff in next week's homework.
