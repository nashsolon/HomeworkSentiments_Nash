I have found this homework to be more challenging than the previous homework. Mostly because, in my opinion, that the concepts require a deeper understanding and I was not doing so well on that. I had to spend a lot of time looking back at the lecture slides, the two textbooks, and lab slides. I would give it a 3 out of 5 rating.
