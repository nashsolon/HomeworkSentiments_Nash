Hw7 is a lot more about realizing what we've learnt in class, specificly, the recommendation system. We need to write our Mapper and Reducer again, which is a great challenge for us. There may be a lot of explaining and calculation for different ways to calculating the distance, which is nice. Overall, I think the instructions is clearer than before and it seems not that hard to implement, but I will have more thoughts on this the moment I begin doing.s
