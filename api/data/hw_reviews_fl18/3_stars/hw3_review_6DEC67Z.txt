This homework was ok, not artificially difficult like the first problem set. It was hard because of the amount of content that we needed to know from the slides, and getting the technical aspect of things right. I hoep things turned out correctly, but not 100% sure about some of my answers. There's just so much detail that needs to be correct, and a lot of terminology that apparently is a little cinconsistent between Hadoop and standard mapreduce file systems. Here's hoping all goes well though. Whee. Rating: 3
