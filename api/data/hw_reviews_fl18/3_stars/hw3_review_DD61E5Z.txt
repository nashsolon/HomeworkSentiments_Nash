I thought this assignment was a little more confusing than the second homework.
Every question in this homework had sections that were either never talked 
about in class or rarely talked about. This made it difficult to use the 
class's resources to complete the homework and instead I looked online to find
other resources that could answer these questions. I thought the homework helped
me understand MapReduce, YARN and Skew which is why I gave it 3 stars.
