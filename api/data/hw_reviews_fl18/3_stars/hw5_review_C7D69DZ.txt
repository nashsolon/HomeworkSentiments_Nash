I thought that this homework was more difficult than most of the past homework assignments, although it wasn't too bad overall. It took us a bit longer than we were used to to complete it. I think that I learned the most from problem 3 where we created an inverted index. This was a topic that had not been discussed in class so far, and I thought it was useful how we learned to use an input file format that directly created key-value pairs. Our implementation to this problem also required some debugging, which made me think even more thourougly about how the map reduce job was set up. This homework assignment was fine overall.
