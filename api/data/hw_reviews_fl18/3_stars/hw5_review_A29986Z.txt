This homework was not the best in my opinion. Some of the questions were hard to understand such as 3a and 2a. Both were incredibly hard to understand and come up with answers that seemed sufficient. More direction would have been wanted on both ends. Other than that the homework was fine, and no other major complaints in regards to questioning. The content was cool to see in action though, which is nice. This homework kinda sucked because it was tedious.
