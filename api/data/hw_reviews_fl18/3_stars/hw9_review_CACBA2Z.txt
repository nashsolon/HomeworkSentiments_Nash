I thought the homework was generally a pretty good introduction to using spark, the spark shell, and writing python files to run in spark but I did not like how some of the directions seemed to be pretty confusing. The beginnnig of problem 1 and problem 2 were the same and it asked me how we stored the data in problem 3 even though we were not supposed to store the data. A bit more explanation of what we were supposed to do could have also been helpful. Other than that though, I thought I learned a great deal about writing programs in spark and how to manipulate a dataset to obtain what I want to within spark.
