HW2 had a lot of great problems. I really enjoyed looking further into the reason behind certain decisions in HDFS such as the block sizes, and the disadvantages and advantages to those. The problems regarding MapReduce were really helpful, especially to really think and understand what is happening in the steps, and if writing a program, what functions map() and reduce() may take on to result in the desired outcome and format.
