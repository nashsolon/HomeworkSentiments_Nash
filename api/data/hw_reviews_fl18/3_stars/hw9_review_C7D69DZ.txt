I thought that this homework assignment was okay. I like using pyspark more than map reduce, but I thought that some of the instructions were unclear, especially for problem 2(e). It took us a while to figure that part of the homework out. At first, the code we wrote for this took hours to run and never finished, which needed to be solved a different way. The vague instructions were a bit frustrating, but once we figured it out I thought I learned a lot from this homework.
