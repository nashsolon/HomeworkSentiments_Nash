Compare to previous hw, this one requires more calculation (especially on problem 2 and 3). This is fine to me. Most of the explanation questions were covered in lecture. The first question was about lab materials and the questions were a little ambiguous to me. I think first question is the hardest among the three problems in this hw.This homework in general is easier than previous one. The first problem is able to complete when follow the lab instruction. The only challenge is that we need to write the whole driver, mapper and reducer class, which we never did before. The second problem is not hard to solve, but some explanation requires careful thought.
