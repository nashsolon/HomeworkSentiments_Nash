I found the homework to be somewhat helpful. 
Problem 2 was good in a sense that I had to derive an equation, and it was very interesting because it forced me to think about the problem a lot more. 
However, I found problem 1 to be a bit repetitive and not very helpful because it wasn't very challenging. 
Problem 3 was so-so because I think I focused on finding the answer to the problem more than internalizing the article, just because of the fact that I had 3 questions I needed to answer.
