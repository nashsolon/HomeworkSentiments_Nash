This homwork is has much difference with previous ones. Comparing with other homeworks, it focus more on mathmatics. Doing mathmatical computation by hand is kind of annoying. It is complex to write down the output and inputs step by step. But I have to admit that it is helpful. Computation by hand can help us make a deep understanding of the principle of algorithm. So I think this homework is not too bad.
