This homework focus on a modified version of co-occurrence problem which we introduced in class. With deep insight of examples in class, we can easily induct the implementation of this homework and writing code. After implementing code,  we dig more into analyzing the result and different efficiency using different methods. Problem 2 and 3 are typically focused on collaborative filtering, including different measures and a item-item method to do collaborative filtering.
