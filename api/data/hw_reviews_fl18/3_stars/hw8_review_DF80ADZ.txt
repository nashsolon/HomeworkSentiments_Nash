this homework is very, very interesting. To be honest, this is my first time contact pig and spark, it took me some time to figure it out. I really like this process. To see how simple code to change thecontent of the file to what we want. 
about the pyspark, thanks for the three functions provided by professor. otherwise i really don't know how to do it.
And about the pig, at first I'm a litte confused about the pig filename and pig -x local filename. So error comes a lot. I'm glad finally I solved it and I should be more careful.
