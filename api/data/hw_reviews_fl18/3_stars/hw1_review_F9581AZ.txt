I was surprised when I first saw the homework, it was really different than I had imagined and it looked long and intimidating. I was worried a lot and want to find a partner first to work on it together. Also, I procrastinated during the first week so I was rushing it during weekdays. It went better than I thought, information can be found from the material so I gradually calmed down after I actually started. Also, my teammate is really reliable and supportive, I feel motivated to contribute more next time.
