For hw1, the first question is highly related to materials we learned in the lecture class and the ppt provided in the class is helpful. This question helps us to understand bata data characters. The second question is tricky the first time we read the article in the textbook and try to do this problem. The answer table provided for us to check the answer is really good and helpful. The last question is the most challenge question for our group since both of us are international students. For us, the article/paper is hard to understand and hard to extract the useful information.
