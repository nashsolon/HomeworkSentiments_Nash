I found this homework to be very helpful, but it was also a bit frustrating. I didn't like how unclear problem 2a was. Problem 3a was also frustrating, because it wasn't immediately clear what was meant by the inputformat. I learned a lot from doing part 3 though, so I liked the question overall, but it would be helpful if we had covered more of the maerial surrounding the implementation of it in lecture or lab.
