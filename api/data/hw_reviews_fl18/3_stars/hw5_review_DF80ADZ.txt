This homework is a tough one for me. Good new is that I enjoy coding now. And it's also a good opportunity for me to get better insigt of how mapper and reducer works . After this homework, I think I learned more, and get better insight of hadoop.
All the three problem are different. At first, for the problem one, I made a mistake, I put the first and the last name in opposite name, it took me really long time to find out. Next time I have to be very carefully. The second problem is interesting, at first i try to solve it by using array. But I found out that I can just compare string later. So that become a easy one.
