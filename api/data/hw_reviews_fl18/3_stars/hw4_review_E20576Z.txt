this hw4 is too difficult to me, and I think professor should add some instructions about which problem should be submitted to gradscope and which problem should be submitted through svn commit. I feeled comfused with it all the time. Also, I suggested that professor give the correct answer to the lab, which would help us to know the correctness of the lab.
