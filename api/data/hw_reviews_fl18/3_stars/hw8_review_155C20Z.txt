This is my eighth homework. It is mainly about pig and spark. It helps me get familiar with the schema and syntax of pig and spark. Problem 3 is a bit tricky, because I am not sure what the denominator of the ctr is, all the records or the total number of websites? Additionally, concerning the spark, I cannot really find the syntax reference from the slide. In all, I will rate this homework a 3 stars.
