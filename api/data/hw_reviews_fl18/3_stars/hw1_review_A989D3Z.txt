There are 3 group questions in this homework and I think it's easy to read and effective to examine what we learnt from class. For the third problem, an article introducing a data-based approach to conducting big data missions is provided and after answering questions attached, I got a deeper insight of big data appliication in these days. However, for some questions in question 1, I don't think the description is solid enough to conclude the characteristics of big datasets, more specific details should be provided.
