This homework is very useful. In this homework, I determined the characteristics of different datasets, it is a good application of the definition of the data characteristics. Also, it asks me to think more about whatâ€™s behind the data, rather than only looking at the data on the surface. The second problem is a good application of mathematics. The reading for the third problem tells me more about data and a way deal with them.
