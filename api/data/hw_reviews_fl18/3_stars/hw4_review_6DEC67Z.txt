This lab was confusing but the confusion helped me learn a lot. It took the most time out of the homeworks that we've done so far. I hope the future homeworks don't take this long and have a bit clearer examples for how to implement the methods that we've learned. In all, I think it was a pretty decent lab. Rating 3
