I feel like this assignment was both easy and hard. The easy part was the coding for problem 1, which is basically a simplify version of what we did on during the lab. It was fun but have some issue that was really hard to solve that took me so long until a TA answered my question. The question 2 and 3 are very difficult to do because to be honest the lecture still left me full of question on these stuff, but thatâ€™s probably because I  never took a matrix class before.
