I thought that the first and third problems of this homework were interesting. For the first problem, it was nice to see how to use custom data types in a MapReduce job. For the third problem, it was interesting to learn how to obtain the file name and use it in a MapReduce job. I did not think the second problem was as interesting however. Overall, I think this homework was fairly average.
