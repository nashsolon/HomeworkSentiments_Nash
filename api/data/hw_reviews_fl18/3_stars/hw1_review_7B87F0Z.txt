I like the article we had to read for this assignment qutie a bit. I did not, however, like the questions following the article. They did not drive any meaningful insight and it seemed tome that they only served as a check that we actually read the paper. I do not think we need any busy work holding us accountable in a 400-level CSE class. It speaks to a lack of confidence in the students on behalf of the instructors. I hope the TA's and Dr. Neumann are reading these reviews so that they can take the feedback into account in future homework assignments.
