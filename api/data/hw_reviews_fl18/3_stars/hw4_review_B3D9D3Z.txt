this homework is more difficult and takes longer than previous one to finish. It is code-heavy and we need to understand the concepts very well in order to do this homework. When I was doing it, I realized I don't really understand some concepts well and I might need to review on those later. Overall, it is a good hands-on experience for us to really know the concepts.
