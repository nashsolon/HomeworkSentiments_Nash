For the sake of the future sentiment analysis assignment that will involve these bonus problems, I am going to make this response slightly more negative than usual. I thought that this assignment was not good; in fact, I thought that it was fairly difficult and ambiguous. Although this gave me an opportunity to think more deeply about the problem, I felt that a bit more direction would have helped.
