The MMDS website wasn't accessible for a period of time, and it was dreadful. 
The article we had to read felt like it was not aimed for an audience such as us--students. Seemed to me that it contained a lot of high level concepts. It felt like I lacked sufficient backgoround knowledge to readily understand the article. My friend went to a TA office hour for help on Wednesday, but soon left because the TA allegedly "did not know".
