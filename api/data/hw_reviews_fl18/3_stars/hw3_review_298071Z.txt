I gave this homework 3/5 stars. I found it a bit confusing and different resources were contraditory when trying to find answers. Also there was a lot of emphasis on stuff that wasn't heavily talked about in class - however, there can be arguments made for why this would be a good thing. The questions were a bit unclear, especially in problem 3, as it seemed like a lot was packed into one question that could maybe be broken into parts.
