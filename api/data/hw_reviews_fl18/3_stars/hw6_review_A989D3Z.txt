In this homework we implement a top-n-list program based on what we learnt from lecture and the steps we followed in lab. This program contains 2 jobs, and it;s the first time I encounter a program which includes multiple jobs. From this homework I'm more familiar with coding for mapper, reducer and driver. Since we have no sample code which has be given by professor in previous homework, this home is quite challenge but I really enjoy this process.
