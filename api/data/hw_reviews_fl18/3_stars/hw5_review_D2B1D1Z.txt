In my opinion, this homework is kind of confusing. Some knowledge that is required to be used is not coverd in the lecture, such as index and global sort. So I have to retrive some useful information from both the slides and text book. The process of searching is hard and boring. But it is also a way to learn. By reading the text book by myself, I can even get a deeper understanding about the knowledge. So I think is also a good way to do homework like this.
