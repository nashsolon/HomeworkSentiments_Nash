this homework is also code heavy and takes long time to do. It is difficult to do and it requests lot of efforts to debug and have everything implemented correctly and nicely. We have to understand the workflow of two jobs very well and what's happening in between job execution to be able to do this homework. My teamamte and i both feel this homework is a good practice to really know stuff well
