this homework is much harder than before. I am uncertain about the answers to many questions. Also, the grading criteria of TA is also wierd and too strict, lacking flexibility. some sentences are not so clear-presented such as the problem 2 in this homework 3, so I wish that the questions could have some more clear explanation or examples.
