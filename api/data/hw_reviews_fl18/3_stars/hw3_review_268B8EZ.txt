In this homework, there is no calculations but these problems help me better understand the process of HDFS and MapReduce process.Some of these questions are boring and it's so difficult for me to find a specific answer on the book.In the future, There are still many improvement especially my reading skills need to be done. And in the end, I want to say that it will be better if there's more hints or score rules in our homework.
