I enjoyed this homework assignment. I liked problem 1. I didn't like problem 2. Part e was really frustrating. It took a very long time to run on some of the problems. Problem 4 was unclear, because the answer was conditional on the format of the graph. Problem 3 was helpful because it clarified what was happening where for each job.
