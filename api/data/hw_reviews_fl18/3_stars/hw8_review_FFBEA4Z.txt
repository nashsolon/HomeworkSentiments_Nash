This homework was overall pretty good, but I thought that it was too long.  I like that it was largely implementation based, because I can reason about these questions on my own with some help from the ta's.  I thought this homework did not need to be 5 questions long, because each question, besides question 5, was pretty involved.  Also, I found it strange that spark was on this homework, even though the lab that corresponded to the homework was the pig lab.  This means that I had to answer questions about spark without having used it (except for a couple days before the homework was due).  Doing the labs helps my conceptual understand, so I don't like when there are questions for which the material was only covered in lecture.
