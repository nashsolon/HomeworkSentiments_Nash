I think I learned a lot from this homework. I think using toolrunner is a much better way to execute jobs, so it's good we know how to do that now. I do have issues with the second problem, though. It was very unclear what was meant by "make sure you use distributed cache," especially because the example given in lecture is a completely different case than ours. Overall though, I think it was a good learning experience.
