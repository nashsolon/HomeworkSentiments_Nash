I feel somewhat OK about the homework 1 overall. Question 1 is a good review of the core concepts of the characteristics of big data, although I find some of the characteristics are ambiguious among different contexts. Question 2 provides a good intuition about the Bonferroni's principle, as well as a little math practice. Question 3 is a hard one, since for me, the essay is a little bit too technical to understand, so I find answering some of the sub-questions difficult. TA is very helpful :)
