As the first homework assignment, I definitely appreciated the thoroughness of the problems given. The information in the problems is thorough and complete, and I did not feel too lost looking for information to double check my answers from the class slides and the textbook reading. I think the problems are definitely thought-provoking, especially the article. I found the article to be the most difficult problem, even after reading the article a few times.
