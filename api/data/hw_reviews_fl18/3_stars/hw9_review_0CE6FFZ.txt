homework 9 is not mediocre from my perspective. although question 1 is a good refresh of the materials covered during the lecture and lab, question 2 is a little bit tedious. for example, part a is a redundant question. for part e, i think it was trying to ask us to join part b with part c, and I was confused at first. also part e didn't mention that we need to create a python file instead of using spark shell, so I've wasted a lot of time debugging and i was upset. question 3 and 4 are not bad. overall i rate this homework mediocre.
