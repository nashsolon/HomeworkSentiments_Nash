The compare method requires quite some thinking. Actually, nevermind. I was stupid. It was the exact same as Lab 4. This homework was fun, would have been better if we had a bit more TIME, considering the fact that we had WILD, one of the few things that WashU students are encouraged to ENJOY. I hope the sentimental analysis miserably fails on this one. ;)
