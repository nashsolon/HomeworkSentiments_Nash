Homework 2 has more questions than hw1. Some of the questions are open-ended which encourages us to think deeper. I think if we could make clearer about what we should do at every beginning of each homework, it will be better. Overall, I think hw2 is okay. My understanding of the relationship between hw and lab would be hw swill focus more on theoretical aspect and labs lay more emphasis on practical. IIUC, I hope that there could also have more exercises on the labs for us to get used to use Linux command and Hadoop syntax!
