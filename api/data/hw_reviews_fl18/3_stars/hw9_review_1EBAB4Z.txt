This homework helped me understand how to transform data using sparks and get the values I want from a log file. It is a very practical problem that can come up in the real world. It also helped me understand how to load values from relational database and how to process that data. I learned how joining two RDDs work. In addition it was helpful in understanding spark job execution and page ranksâ€™s data representation.
