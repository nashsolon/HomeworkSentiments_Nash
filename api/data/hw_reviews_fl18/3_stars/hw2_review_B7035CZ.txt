Homework 2 is similar to homework 1 in that it asks a lot of conceptual questions. Similarly these questions are kind of too abstract and general to me and I didn’t feel that I gain a lot via this. But still, I learnt the advantages and disadvantages of HDFS such as it doesn’t support low-latency applications and multiple writers , also it doesn’t allow modifications at arbitrary offsets. I also reviewed map and reduce.
