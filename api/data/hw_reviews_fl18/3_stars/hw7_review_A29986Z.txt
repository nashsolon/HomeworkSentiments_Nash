I thought this homework was written very poorly because I had to ask clarifying questions for question 1 part b and c many times and it can be seen in piazza as well. For question 1b, it should have been clarified that shakespeare data should be with the glossary removed and that we cannot handle the cases that words get split up between lines. I think overall I did learn stuff about the tradeoffs of the correlation measures and the stripes and pairs methods and stuff.
