This is like how I feel about most 427 homework. Mostly confused at first, then took a detour through course materials and google, with someone else's help i finally arrive at some conclusion. BBut i'm still unsure about whether im on the right track or not. I hope I can survive this class. I panic everytime I do the homework and things haven't changed since homework 3 or 4. Sorry but I don't think I'm the biggest fan of the homeworks. I suck...
