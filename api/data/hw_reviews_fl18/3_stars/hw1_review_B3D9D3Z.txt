I rate this hw 3 stars. The first question is basic over the concepts we covered in class and it is fairly easy to complete. The second question is related to probability and once understands the question, it's also fairly easy to complete. The third question however, is reading over a scholar paper and thus in it has a lot of academic words such as overfitting, semantic web and stuff. I haven't taken machine learning course before. So I have to google many terms in order to understand most of the paper. And thus costs a lot of time and sometimes makes me drowsy to read because the info is overwhelming. But overall I learned a lot from this hw (though it is largely based on active learning of ourselves)
