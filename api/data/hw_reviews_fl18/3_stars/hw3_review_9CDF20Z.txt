I think this homework assignment was very useful in my learning of Cloud Computing. I am positive on the reading that was required for the assignment, as I feel that it contributed significantly to my understanding of the subject matter. I think that, in the future, the homeworks can be less focused on writing a good document responding to questions and more focused on practicing the underlying techniques. Thank you for your consideration! I appreciate the evaluation and opportunity to gain extra credit.
