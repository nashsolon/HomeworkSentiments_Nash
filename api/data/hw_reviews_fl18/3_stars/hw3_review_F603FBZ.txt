Today was a very rough day. I woke up very early to an emergency phone call from the DMV which required me to get to the license office as soon as possible to fix up some paperwork. But afterwards I found out that my tire is stub by a nail and needed replace the tires. They are expensive and I am pretty sad. Also, I received some rough and harsh messages from my dad yesterday which said things on the line of "stop worrying about getting an internship. Focus on applying for a PhD program. I was very unhappy about your college application process regardless how much you are enjoying yourself at WashU". He has a point, but it's not the brightest or the most chearful conversation ever. This homework is alright. I think some of the questions are a bit anbiguous. But after consulting with the professor they became a bit clearer.
