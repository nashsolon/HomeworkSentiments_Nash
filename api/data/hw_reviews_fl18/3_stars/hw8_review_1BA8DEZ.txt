This homework is kind of tedious. I spend a lot of time on the homework, not because it is difficult, but because its requirement is very long and I have to go through many steps to try to figure out the right answer. When faced with many strange questions, I have to spend a lot of time to figure out what it means. Hope next time, it will cost me much less time.
