I thought that the first homework assignment was interesting and it was a good way to start working us into the main material of the semester. The first part of the assignment was helpful as it forced us to look into the real characteristics of big data which is important as we will be discussing big data a lot throughout the class. I did not really understand the purpose of Part 2 of the assignment as it had a lot more to do with probability than big data but it was a good mental exercise that may be related to some computation skills needed as we begin to manipulate big data. I found the article that we read for Part 3 as a very good read but was disappointed by the questions as they seemed to be a bit ambiguous. The terms used in the questions were not the same as the ones the author was using in the article and inferences on what the questions actually meant needed to be made.
