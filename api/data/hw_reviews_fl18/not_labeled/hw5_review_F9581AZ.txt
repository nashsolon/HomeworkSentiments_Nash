I can't believe I haven't figure out the course logistics until the fifth homework! So I spent a whole night reviewing the lecture notes, lab slides, lab instructions and reading materials. They are just structured in a confusing way... The wording of this homework is not clear too I saw quite a few piazza posts asking about the questions themselves. I felt so not motivated to do the homework so I didn't start until Saturday afternoon. I already knew it's gonna end badly. Anyway I need new motivations for this course.
