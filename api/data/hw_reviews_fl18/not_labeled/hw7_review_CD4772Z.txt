After the last two homeworks that were heavily focused on coding, the homework was a good break from that. The first problem was code but wasn't as difficult as the last 2 previous homework and didn't require as much time to complete. Overall, I did enjoy this homework and it helped me review the materials in the book since I had to reread some sections to be able to answer the questions in the homework.
