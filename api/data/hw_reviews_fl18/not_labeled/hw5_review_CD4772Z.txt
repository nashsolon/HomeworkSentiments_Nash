I like this homework better than the previous homework. The code that needs to be written is quite similar to the ones we've gone over in class or in labs so it wasn't too difficult. However, for question 3, I couldn't find any code that is an implementation of the File Split and getPath() method so it took a while for me to figure out, after doing some research online. Additionally, question 2 wasn't extremely clear. I had questions similar to people on Piazza but I didn't feel like the answers were helpful in clarifying the question in the homework.
