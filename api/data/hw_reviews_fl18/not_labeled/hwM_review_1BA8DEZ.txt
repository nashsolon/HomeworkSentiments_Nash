This is the last homework of the class. I have learnt a lot from the class. Although it's kind of challenging for me at the beginning, I tried to overcome the difficuly to make through it. I really want to say thanks to the Professor. She helpt me a lot in the semester. I wish I could attend her class in the following semesters. I appreciate it!
