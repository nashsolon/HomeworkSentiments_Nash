I really enjoyed this home work because I belieb that it made me have to think a lot about how to best implement mad reduce algorithms. The github guide that we were given was a huge help and I am happy that we recieved a resource to help us guide our thought. This is also a really cool implemetation of the power of map reduce and how it can be used to create solutions in the real world. I hope the next home work is similar to this one because it was great.
