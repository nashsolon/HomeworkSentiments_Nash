This homework is really helpful to me. In the first problem, i practiced how to count the word co-occurrence in a text file by writing java scripts for the hadoop task. In the second prolem, i learnt how similarity and normalization works and how they can improve the counting work. In the third prolem, i practiced the dual approach of collabrative filtering. These problems gave me a chance to put what i leanrt in class into practice and are really useful.
