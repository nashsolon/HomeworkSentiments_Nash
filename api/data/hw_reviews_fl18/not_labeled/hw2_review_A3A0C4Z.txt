Homework 2 was a good introduction to understanding the way files are stored in the hadoop filesystem. I think having us copy and paste the exact commands we used to do the various specified tasks is a good way to have us not only understand how things work under the hood, but also to gain some practical experience of executing commands that directly interface with the hadoop file system. Also, with respect to mapReduce, manually computing the process that a MapReduce program uses is a really good way to understand how exactly a mapreduce program works. It really isn't that trivial of a process, and is different from the way a similar problem would be solved using regular computing.
