It's really weird that i was running into problems like exceeding memory and stuff. My operations look normal and most of the commands I ran are provided. I'm also really bad at analysing error messages so it took me a lot time to rerun the scripts to figure out if I did something wrong. As for the homework I think 2(e) is the most uncertain. It's not as straightforward as the others and it took me the longest time. But other than that i guess it's ok.
