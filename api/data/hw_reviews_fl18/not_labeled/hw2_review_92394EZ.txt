I enjoyed this homework assignment. I think that it allowed me to better understand the material. When it had me reference the book though, that wasn't very helpful. I found that the answer wasn't really in the book. It was nice to get some more practice with hadoop commands. Overall I liked it but it would be nice to have more hadoop practice.
