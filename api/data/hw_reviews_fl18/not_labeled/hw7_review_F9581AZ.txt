I went through a discouraging path of coming up with solutions to problem 2 and 3. I was lost in the information give in the lecture slides about Jaccard similarities. The information given is concise and limited, I couldn't find anything useful in my notes either so I went online and tried to gather helpful information. For problem 3 I have always been confused by the input and output format. I guess it is because I still don't understand the material well so I'm having trouble applying it.
