I think this time the homework requires us to use what we learned recently such as pig and spark to deal with the data and such work seems like the real task instead of only a simple homework in school. But I think there are some problems that makes me feel crazy. For example, in problem 3, there are several files we need to use to create a final file, but we do not know where the files are. And it takes us much time to deal with it.
