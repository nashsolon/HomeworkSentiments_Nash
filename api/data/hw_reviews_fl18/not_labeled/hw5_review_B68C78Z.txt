As we have done similar things in the previous lab, and this time we avoid wasting much time on how to write code in eclipse and run the file through terminal. But I think this time the problems are harder to understand. For each problem, especially problem 2, we are confused about what they want us to do and what type of answer we would get. And I think it is not good because it is useful if we spend time writing the code or adjust it instead of trying to figuring out the meaning of a problem.
