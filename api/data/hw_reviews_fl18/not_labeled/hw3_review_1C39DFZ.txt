hw3 is good like before, but I want to talk about the criteria of homework correcting because I am not fully satisfied with some TA'S opinion, sometimes when I gave my answer, they didn't read what I wrote carefully and gave simple answer, OK, sometimes I might be wrong, but please hurry up and give me the reasons why I was wrong, you may need to wait like a whole week to get the feedback.
