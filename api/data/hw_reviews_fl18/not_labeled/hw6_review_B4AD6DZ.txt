I like this homework a lot more than the last few homework. I think it is largely because I really enjoyed the lab related to this homework. The lab for the top-n-list was interective and fun for me, and made me really understand how the program work way more I did in previous one where I have to check the textbook to understand my task. Overall I feel this way of learning is fun for me also way more efficient.
