this homeword is so troublesome. being honest, review the lab9 took me really long time. eventhough I finally finished it, but the homework is still hard. the problem 2 took us so much time. But we're glad that we may finished it, I'm not sure. Since it took the program to run like an hour to get the result.
My favorite problem in this homework is problem3, which is very useful, I think I may use the idea in reality. Well maybe the reality problem may not this straghtforward, but can get the idea from this problem is enough.
