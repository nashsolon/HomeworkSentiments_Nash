I enjoyed this weeks assignment a lot. It got a little technical, while also staying understandable. I liked how there were some hints that referenced specific sections of the textbook too read. I also liked how we had to think through processes that I might typically overlook such as the flow of the program through different daemons. I almost forgot to do a section which was almost bad, but it turned out alright in the end as I remembered to do it in time.
