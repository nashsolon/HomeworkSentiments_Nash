I gave this homework a review of 4 stars. once again, I thought it was a good assignment in the sense that there was a lot of coding and real world problem solving. In this sense, this homework seemd pretty relevant for real-world applications. A problem that I had with the homework is that it wasn't clear whether or not we were supposed to pre-process the data (delete duplicate records), and you get different answers depending on whether or not you do this. Also, many of the instructions were a bit unclear.
