This time the code part is very easy, so I spend less time on the code.
But the writeup part is a little bit difficult. There are more math things than before. 
I think it's better to do more math things, because it will help us understand the material and would not be as boring as statement problem.
Further more, I think problem 3 would be better if it need us to program the whole job.
