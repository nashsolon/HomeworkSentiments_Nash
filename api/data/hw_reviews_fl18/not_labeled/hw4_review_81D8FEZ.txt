This homework contains two program, the first one is to pass a Parameter via the Command Line by the lab4 code. We use ToolRuner and configuration parameter in this problem to change the status of case-sensitive or case-insensitive, which help me learn more about them. The second one is using the word count program in lab2 with the Partitioner to separate the three status to 3 reduce tasks. After that we find there are some improvements that can apply on this program~
