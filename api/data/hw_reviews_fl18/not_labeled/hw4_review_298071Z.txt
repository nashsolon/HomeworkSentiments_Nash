I gave this hw a 4/5. This homework was definitely more involved, but I enjoyed using eclipse because I am somewhat comfortable with it. I liked the more hands on aspect of it because even though it took a lot more time to acctualy implemet things that answer questions, I feel like it really helps me understand what is happening and how different things interact. (plus, trial and error is by far the best way of learning even if it is a bit frustrating)
