This assignment was finished with a lot stress since I'm in the middle of mid-terms. And there are a lot of materials to go over before i can really started. I got really anxious since my friends finished them in less than a day and i estimated this to be an 4-day work. Anyway with uncertainty and doubts I started from lab and the git sample code. It was struggling and I still feel there should be a more unified form of instructions. I couldn't really work comfortably withought using my other laptop as a second screen. As always my partner was being reliable and i appreciated that a lot. If we could communicate more I think would be of great help to me.
