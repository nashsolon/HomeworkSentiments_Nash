This homework took a really long time, especially with the top-n list implementation because there were a lot of things that needed to be implemented. Additionally, it took me a long time to debug and I'm still learning and experimenting on which way works best for me when debugging. The questions asked in the homework weren't too difficult but the implementation definitely was very time-consuming.
