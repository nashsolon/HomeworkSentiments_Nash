I enjoyed this homework assignment. I felt like it was a nice balance between qualitative information, mathematics, and readings. The qualitative content was nicely connected to the lecture, and the quantitative content was a good challenge, yet doable. The time it took was appropriate in my opinion and I would rate this as a positive assignment overall.
