This week we wrote homework 3 based on lectures and lab about the whole process of mapreduce. There are three questions included and each question corresponds to a single part of mapreduce. From this homework I reviewed the whole process of record reader, mapper, shuffle and sort, reducer and write back to HDFS as a permanent storage. What's more, this homework also requires reading about skew, which deepens my understanding of reduce tasks. At last, there is a problem about YARN and how to analyze expected result based on concept we learn from class.
