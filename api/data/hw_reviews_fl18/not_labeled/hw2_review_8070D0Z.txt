This assignment was a pretty good assignment. I enjoyed the topics being covered because I find map reduce to be fairly easy, at least in general concept. The first part was okay because while it did have many interesting questions, I had to resort to my book for some answers. While this isnâ€™t an issue at all, it was just one extra step beyond the slides. The rest was fairly straight forward but could have specified whether we were to draw diagrams or simply the outputs.
