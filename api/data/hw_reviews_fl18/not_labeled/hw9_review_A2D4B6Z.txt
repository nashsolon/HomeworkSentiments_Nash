This was a great homework to work on with pyspark - however I would really like to have more details printed on the homework statements in the future because sometimes we were unsure what we needed to include in our pdf. I also think it would be better if the homework pdfs told us how many points each gave us - so that we would know how many marks we would lose for incorrect output. Many students during office hours had slightly different output with largely similar code so it was confusing and we were unsure as to why that was happening.
