This was my favorite assingment so far. I really liked the math and the application of all the stuff we are learning in class. I loved that this homework had a good balance between math components and coding components. The most important thing I learned was how to do the proper math for the algorithms, and how to properly configure a mapreduce program to get information like line number and filename. In the future I would like to check out TA hours.
