I definitely enjoyed the faster execution time of spark vis-a-vis that of either hive or Java MR. I also enjoyed an opportunity to analyze text. However, I found it difficult to understand syntax for some of the spark comments, as I was getting a large number of parsing errors. I wish there was also more opportunity to explore pipelining. Most important hting I learned was probably the lazy execution/pipelining, which greatly sped up the process of running. I was surprised that three comments including ten times more were the exact same, just because it's very unlikely that three comments will be identical in the real wordl. If I could start over again, I would definitely try to sketch the database and table structure and think about what needs to be queried, rather than trying arbitrarily different queries
