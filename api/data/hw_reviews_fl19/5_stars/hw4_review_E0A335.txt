What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
This is the first Assignment with code submission, I like writing code and see them running and getting all the results from my code. this is excited for me.
I also like to answer the question like why sometimes this method won't work, and how you can improve them. this makes me think critically.
Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?
If I could start over I would go to the TA hour to ask about how to read the txt file line by line into the program. I spent almost an hour to figure this out.
