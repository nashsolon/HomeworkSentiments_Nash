1. I like the problem 1 and problem 2 because these can help us to review the content we learn in class and practice it. But I do not like the problem 3 because reading paper is difficult for a beginner. I prefer some practice or project assignment.

2. The different dimensions of big data. We should think about 5 characteristics of it and each of them need us to think about different methods in storage, process and use the data.

3. How common the big data is surprised me a lot. I know some data set like credit card record, but do not realize that even the data set of chemical compounds is big enough and have such a huge amount. Big data is everywhere around us.

4. Pay more time to read the paper and answer problem 3 better. Because reading academic paper is my weak part.
