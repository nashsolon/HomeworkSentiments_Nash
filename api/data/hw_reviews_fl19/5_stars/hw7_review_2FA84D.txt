This homework helped me a lot to understand how to implement top n list mapreduce program. Moreover, I understand what are the trade offs between 
two different implementations. I really liked everything but the only thing I did not like from this homework is the slides were not really helpful to
answer the questions. If I could start over again, I would read the required textbook first and then move on to the implementation.
