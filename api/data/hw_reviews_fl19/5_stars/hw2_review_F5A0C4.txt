I enjoyed working through the example mapreduce problems, and stepping through each part of the process to see the inputs and outputs. The most important thing I learned was the methods in which computers employed mapreduce methods to tackle large computational problems. If I could start over, I would read through the lecture slides to get a good grasp on the example problems, before moving onto the homework.
