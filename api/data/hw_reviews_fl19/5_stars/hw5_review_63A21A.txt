I like the assignment because it reviews different similarity measures and compare them from different perspectives.And the problem of inverted index is a practical application of mapreduce from which I learned alot of the input format of mapreduce. I wish the assignment could include some materials about Jaccard similarity and the Pearson correlations because the relevant content in the textbook is not quite enough to answer the questions. If I could do it again, I would go over the textbook before coding.
