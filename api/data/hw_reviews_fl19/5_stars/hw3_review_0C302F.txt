In this assignment, I got to understand more of what the hadoop mapreduce does in detail. I like that it got my thinking more about how to reduce function operates and what a combiner is in the mapduce process. I didn't really like the problem about YARN initially, but after reading more about it, I think I'm understanding what is YARN. I think the most important thing I learned from this homework is about YARN. I didn't understand it from lecture slides, but the textbook was very helpful for my undersgtanding of YARN and of skew in data.
