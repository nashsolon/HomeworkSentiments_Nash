(1) What I like the most about this assignment is question 2 f, where it asks for us to draw the spark flow of the whole problem. In order to do this question, I really need to understand where spark do repartition, and where we can have parallel tasks. My partner and I spent a lot of time discussing how to define the stages, and learning whether or not does 'join' require repartition.
(2) If I can do this assignment again, I would start with be more careful and pay more attention during the labs. I missed some instruction when setting up the environment, and when loading the data. This made me redo many parts of my assignment.
