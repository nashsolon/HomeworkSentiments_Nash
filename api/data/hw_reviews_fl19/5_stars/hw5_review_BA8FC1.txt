I especially like problem 2. The example in MMD is a very useful guide to help me get this problem done. More importantly, part (c) and (d) shows me that the similarity measure could be modified and improved. And there could be some intrinsic relationships between different measures. Also, some good steps, such as normalization, in the preprocessing could produce a better result. This also inspired me to think of other possible ways to preprocess the data to improve the quality of measure.
I probably would review some knowledge of statistics. I found this knowledge helped me truly understand the meaning of the Pearson correlation. In other words, it is necessary to understand why the Pearson correlation is defined in this form instead of just implementing and using it.
