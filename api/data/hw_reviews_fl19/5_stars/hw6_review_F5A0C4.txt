I enjoyed working through and implementing the comparator and partitioners, and seeing how they affect the final reducer output. I thought the questions could have been worded more clearly, especially the conceptual questions regarding advantages and disadvantages of certain choices. I also learned a lot about the default functionality of ordering and comparisons, and how to implement custom partitioners to globally sort. If I could start over again, I would work through the mapper input and outputs and reducer input and output of the secondarysort to get a better understanding of what the input and output going into the partitioner and comparators are.
