I enjoyed implementing a real-world example mapreduce function using the Netflix data. I learned how to use Hadoop statistics to analyze the various components of the job and use those statistics to determine an estimate of the communication cost. Additionally, I learned the usefulness of a combiner in decreasing workload on the reducer. The most important thing I learned was how to chain two mapreduce jobs (aggregation and then sum) to achieve the desired output.
