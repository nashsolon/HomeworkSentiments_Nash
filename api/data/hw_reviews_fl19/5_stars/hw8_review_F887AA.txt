This homework was an overall great set of exercises to get used to hive and spark. I liked that fact how for hive, we had different small problems to implement the concepts we learned both from class and the lab on our own. It was also a great opportunity to review SQL. Problem 5, for getting used to spark, was pretty fun to work on. It took me and my team member a little bit to get used to the syntax, but that was not too much trouble. Overall, this homework was nicely distributed between hive and spark, and also was not too frustrating to solve. I really liked this homework.
