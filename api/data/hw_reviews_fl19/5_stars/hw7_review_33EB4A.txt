I like this assignment because I think it is really helpful and challenging. It provides me with a futher understanding of recommendation mapreduce job . And it enhances my hand-on experience with mapreduce implementation.

2.I am suprised that the first problem takes me a lot of time to debug, especially for the reducer part. It took me a long time to come up with a way to store id-title. Luckily, I soloved this problem at the end. 

4.I would re-do the lab 6 and be more familiar with how partitioner works in a mapreduce job. Also, I would review the slides, which is really helpful to the problem 3.
