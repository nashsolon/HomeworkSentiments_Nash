I enjoyed first implementing and then seeing the effects of a custom partitioner, plus learning a bit about the implementation of comparables. A dislike is again the long runtimes of our jobs when testing on the hadoop cluster. The most important thing I learned is probably how to write a custom partitioner based on what we intend todo, because then we can customize the sorting based on what we want to do. I was surprised to learn that sometimes, different people were returned because we only sorted by last name and the year of birth, not by the full date, and thus sometimes the youngest person of a particular last name may have been different for different runs. If I could start over from the beginning, I would have tried to build up the nswer to problem 3b based on mapper 1 outputs, reducer 1 inputs and outputs, mapper 2 inputs and outputs, reducer 2 inputs, and reducer 2 outputs.
