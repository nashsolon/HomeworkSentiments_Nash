I like this assignment a lot because it helps me tremendously in terms of understanding how YARN works in MapReduce. While I was clear how Mapper and Reducer work, I was not that clear on how the server schedules how these things and what data resides where. The most important thing I learned was the idea of combiner and the concept of skew. There was nothing surprising. Most things were covered in class. If I were to start the assignment again, I would choose to read Chapter 7 of HDTG first before start because that chapter is really helpful for this assignment and understanding MapReduce in general. Highly Recommend!
