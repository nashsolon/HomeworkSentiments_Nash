I liked to do the analysis of mapreduce result and possible ways to improve the mapreduce process. 
However, I think it will be more helpful if we are given with more clear and detailed problem descriptions. 
I was little confused of how to answer problem 2 (b). 
The most important thing I learned from this homework is how to resolve a possible skew since it will be my job to handle if I am given 
mapreduce assignments.
