This homework is much better than last one. The question is tightly related the course material, so that I never get lost from the question. The first problem is quite challenging. It requires me to have a good understanding of concepts of HDFS. I'm excited about second and third problems. They help me know how the map and reduce function work. Before I did this homework, I thought that the group and shuffle are included by one step of map or reduce. But I realized that was incorrect on the half way I did the homework. I'm very glad that I learn this thing from the homework.
