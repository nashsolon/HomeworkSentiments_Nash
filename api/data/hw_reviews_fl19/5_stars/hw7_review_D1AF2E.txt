I thought that it was very cool to have an opportunity to implement a Hadoop Mapreduce from scratch. When I first attempted to make start this assignment, it felt like it was a grand feat to do in one sitting, and I didn't really know where to begin. But as I continued on with the step-by-step process of what we learned how to do all semester, it felt more natural. I'm glad that this assignment pointed us to where we don't know, and reasurred our knowledge on Hadoop MapReduce. The following questions were also very interesting, and it was a good oppoortunity to review what we've been taught in class.
