I like the lab as a whole because unlike the previous labs, the questions were based on the codes we wrote and the outputs of those files.  The coding part of the lab was straight forward with sample codes from the workspace folder and from the lecture slides.  In all, this lab was designed to be an engaging learning experience.  The most important thing I learned through this lab was the concept of partitioning.  I was not sure how the partition process works during the MapReduce and this lab clarified that unsureness.  I did not know if it partitioning processed randomly based on the number of reducers or if it had to be specified.
