This was one of my favorite homeworks so far. I thought it did a good job of teaching different parts of a hadoop program through active learning by actually getting to code. I also liked the last problem where it required to do what a mapreduce program would have to do by hand because I think this sets up well todo the next lab. In the future I would ask more questions and start earlier.
