This homework was very interesting is that we got an opportunity to try out different ways of calculating similarities among a given set of user ratings. Problem 1 was a good taste of how indexing can be implemented through MapReduce. Othertwo problems deal more in depth about the similarity computations. In overall, I think I learned a lot and feel more comfortable towards rating computations after finishing the problem set.
