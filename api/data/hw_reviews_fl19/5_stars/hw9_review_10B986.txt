I really like this homework. We practice a lot in Spark, which help facilitate my understanding to the class materials. But I failed to open yarn in my browser and I dont know why. Overall, it is a good homework with really good practice.If I could do the homework again, I would like to start it earlier since I submited my homework just by the deadline.
