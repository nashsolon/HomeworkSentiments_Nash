I like this assignment because all three problems are small but effective. It helps me review the concepts of Spark RDD, distinguish the transformation and new RDD creation of different command and the third problem asks us to write a spark program that count the number of JPG requests in the web log data, which I think is a good practice because in real word we definitely need to count certain type of data in the web log to obtain some information. What I dislike this assignment is that there's nothing about PageRank that we discussed alot in class.
