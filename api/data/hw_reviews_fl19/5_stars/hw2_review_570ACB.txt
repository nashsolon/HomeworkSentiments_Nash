I liked this assignment because it helped me fully understand how MapReduce works. It was a very good practice, especially sketching the cluster state. Problem 2 and 3 were good practices for understanding MapReduce. I wish there could something handson, like areal coding assignment that asks us to write a Mapper and a Reducer ourselves, but I amsure this kind of assignment is on its way. I wasn't surprised by anything. The last question of problem 1 took me a while because I didn't know how the data transfer works. Later I realized that I was probably overthinking it.
