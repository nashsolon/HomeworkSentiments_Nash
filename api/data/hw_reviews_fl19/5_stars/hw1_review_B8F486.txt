t did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?

What I like most about this assignment is that question 1 is very detailed and covers a lot of concepts we learnt in class. I was confused about the characteristics: size and infinity. I had a more thorough understanding of size after I did question (e) asking about data point and data structures. Also, the question allowed me to see the difference between different data types. 

What surprised you, and why?

I was surprised that we have reflection questions from reading an article. The content is not taught in class or textbook, but is related to our class material. I like that we get to read a little more intense material on our own outside the class. The questions helped a lot in understanding the big ideas of the paper.
