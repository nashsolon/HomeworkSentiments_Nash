I like the contents of this assignment. To be specifically, the first problem makes me learn more about HDFS master/slave structure and lets me  get a deeper understanding of some basic but important concepts, such as NameNode, DataNode and Block. Besides, it also gives me an outline of how the file store in HDFS. And the second and the third problem let me be familiar with how to compute the Mapper inputs, Mapper outputs, Reducer inputs and Reducer outputs. 
The most important thing I learned is how files store in HDFS because before this assignment I just have an superficial understanding about this. After this homework,I know the file will be divided into several parts and be stored in several blocks in datanodes. Also it will be copied trice and the replicated data will also be stored in blocks in datanode in different racks which improves the fault tolerance.
