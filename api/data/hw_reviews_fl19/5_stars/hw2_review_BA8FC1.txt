I like the last two problems. Sometimes, the concept is obscure without actually practicing it. The last two problems are the real examples, which are very similar to the problem we did in class. It is good that I got a chance to review what we have learned.
The most important thing I have learned in this homework is knowing that HDFS does not work well in every case. HDFS is really powerful but still has some weakness. It is important to understand its weakness before using it. Knowing what scenario HDFS could not work well and seek other solutions earlier is much better than using HDFS everywhere without caring about its efficiency.
