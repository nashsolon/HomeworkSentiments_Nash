This homework consisted of map reduce program in hadoop in terms of how it works and how each data is stored and processed. Although I get the concept of map reducing, when the homework asked me about skew, I haddifficulty answering since I had a different understanding on skew initially. I also found it difficult to answer questions about data localization optimization, but soon as I understood the need of local optimization, questions were not that difficult. Additionally, by answering problem 1, I think I know how these reflections will be used later on for sentiment analysis. Overall, this homework was more challenging than the previous homeworks, but I learned a lot.
