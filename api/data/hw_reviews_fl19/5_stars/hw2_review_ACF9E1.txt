1.I like this assignment, for it give us a chance to delve deeper into the Hadoop and know more about the basic structure and concepts.Otherwise we may ignore those useful knowledge.
2.The most important thing is about the reflection factor.Because it has a great impact on Hadoop cluster performance.
3.I was surprised by at first when I try to read the head lines of the poems it reported warning of "unable to write to output stream"
4.I think I will do the sketch differently.Because I wanna modify it into a more clear format.
