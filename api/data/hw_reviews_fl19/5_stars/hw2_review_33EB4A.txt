1.I like this assignment it provides me with a further understanding of HDFS and MapReduce by asking some critical questions.

2.I am suprised that we still don't have any coding parts to this assignment and the difficuility of the assignment is really fair.

4.I would review the lecture slides and re-do the lab 1 because it took me lots of time to loop up the slides and command lines during this assignment.
