I really liked that this assignment got to use more python and spark. I also like how this assignment challenged us to think through a lot more of the problems and what happens at each stage of the process. Drawing the DAG was nice to see how the flow worked and made it easy to identify any bottlenecks. Also I made use of checking PIAZA which was super helpful, I had one job where there was a join and it was getting stuck at 311/315 and if you ran it with pyspark --master yarn it solved the problem. This issue was most likey due to a memory constraint but with out the piaza post wouldv'e been extremely difficult to resolve the issue for ssomething that is such an easy fix. In the future I will continue to check PIAZA for most useful information on the assignment. Also as a side note on the last problem I would've like to seen that problem go one step further and actually represent the web graph in a matrix and solve for the pagerank.
