1. For the first question, I think I like this assignment. By doing this assignment, I think I have a much more thorough understanding of PageRank and a more fluent use of Spark.

2. For the fourth question, If I got another chance I think I would go to last Thursday's lecture earlier. On that day, My shoes didn't fit well and My feet got hurt. So I went back home to change another shoes. Out of this, I was late for the lecture and missed the lecture quiz. I regretted a lot.
