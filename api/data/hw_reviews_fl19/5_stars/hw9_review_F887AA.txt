This homework was quite fun to work on. I'm glad we are using more of python. I liked question 3 particularly, as we then combine what we were doing with question 1 and 2 to a whole job execution. In other words, instead of running codes line by line in the spark shell, we got to write a stub file and run it on different environments. It was a little frustrating for some parts because my hue website (localhost jobbrowser) wouldn't appear correctly. Also, bunch of errors and warnings popped up when we tried running the stub file. We couldn't really figure out why the warnings were generated, but the job ran still, fortunately. Overall, I very much enjoyed that we got to work with spark a lot, and that there were several visualization questions, which are very helpful for me.
