I really like this assignment, mainly for two reasons: First of all, the workload is quite fair, it took me about half and an hour to finish it and I think I practiced a lot regarding the coding part and concepts. Second, it is also a more important reason, this assignment has questions about how to write the command line, which requires me to have a deeper memory about the Linux command, has questions about the pros and cons of HDFS, which help me have a better understanding of HDFS theoretically. Also has questions about map function and reduce function. 
Above all, the most important thing I learned is how to write the correct command line in virtual machine. During the process I follow lab1 instructions to store some data in Hadoop, I made some mistakes, which, on the contrary not a bad thing to me. In order to fix these problems, I used the command line with various format, it really helped me understand the code better, since we need to face a much more bigger data size in the real world, and less mistake is better. 
As for what surprised me, it absolutely is the command line! When I followed the instructions and created the correct output, I feel like it is really a dedicate work to do because one little small mistake, maybe a whitespace, will ruin the whole line of command and will not return the result you desire.
