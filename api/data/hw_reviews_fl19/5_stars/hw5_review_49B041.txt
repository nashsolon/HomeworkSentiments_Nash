In this homework. When I finished the code part, I can get the result in the eclipse. At first, I did not care about the result. Because I checked the line listed in the question. It actually the same as the question. But when I uploaded it to the Hadoop. I find I cannot get the same result. When I open the result file. I got nothing except unarrary code. I tried many ways to fix it. Finally, I find that the a was used many times, so the result of a are huge. So my result are not wrong. This is really amazed me.
