I really enjoyed this assignment. I was a big fan of how this homework tied in with the lab, and I liked the coding aspect. In the future for this homework I am going to try to start earlier so if I run into silly errors I can get help to catch them earlier on rather than struggling to figure them out on my own late at night. Overall I really enjoyed this assignment.
