I liked learning about how indexing works in hadoop, as well as the use of key-value input formats and the filesplit. One thing I did not like was again the long runtime of the job, taking several minutes to run on the hadoop cluster. One thing that took us a lot of time was that we forgot to unpack the data inside, just transfering the tgz to the hadoop filesystem, which made it so that our outputs were not in human-readable format. Once we remembered to do this, then it started to work. The most important thing that we learned was how indexing makes it easier to locate words, thus helping to reduce search times and just having pointers to the data
