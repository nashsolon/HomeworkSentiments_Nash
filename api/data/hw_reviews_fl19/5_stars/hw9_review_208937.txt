I like this assignment very much. First of all, it is much easier than the previous homework, I feel really relaxing after completing the homework. Secondly, I become more and more skillful about the spark and know how to write the programs , execute them and successfully get results from them. That's the most important thing I'm happy with the homework. 
As for the thing I learned from this assignment is there are multiple ways for us to complete tasks. we can use Hadoop as what we did before to complete the tasks, but also we can now use spark to retrieve the results. And spark is a more efficient and effective way. Hence it is not enough when we master a new skill. We have to explore more and find more ways for it, in this way, we can complete various tasks more effectively and efficnently.
