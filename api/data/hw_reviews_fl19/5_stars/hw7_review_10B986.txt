I really like this homework. We practice a lot in coding, and I practice many test cases which help facilitate my understanding to the class materials. But I feel like some of the question is the same as before, such as word pair count. Overall, it is a good homework.If I could do the homework again, I would like to start it earlier since I submited my homework just by the deadline.
