Do not feel something special in homework2. For the homework we need to search in different slides and chapters from book. It is annoying sometimes, you find a long paragraph in book that describes it, but you are not sure which part to pick. And sometimes you cannot find where is it on slides or book. Sometimes I may lose score because some describes (at least in hw1), since TA may just wait for some "special word".
