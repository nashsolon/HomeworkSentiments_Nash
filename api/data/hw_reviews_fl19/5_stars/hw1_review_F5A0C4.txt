I enjoyed reading about the application of large data along learning about the experimental pipeline of gathering data in the article. I also thought that formalizing the different characteristics that comprise “Big Data” was also useful, in the three examples from Question 1. I thought it was slightly difficult to figure out ambiguous cases that define “Big Data”, especially since some categories are not white-and-black, but gray as well. The most important things I learned were that widely different datasets with drastically different characteristics can all the same be considered “Big Data”, and that large amounts of data can overcome the lack of structure and annotation.
