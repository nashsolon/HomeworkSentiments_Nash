This homework was enjoyable and helped me become comfortable with using Spark. The problems were broken up nicely so that the each step was incremental. Also the example output was helpful so I knew what exactly I had to do. If I could redo this assignment, I think I would have checked Piazza more frequently. I was stuck on a problem where my join operation was never finishing. The fix was posted by the TA. In addition, I would have made sure how many files I needed. At first I had 312 before ingesting the data again in which i got 311.
