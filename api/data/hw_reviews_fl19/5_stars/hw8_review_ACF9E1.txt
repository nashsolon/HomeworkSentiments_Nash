1.I like this assginment because I think it's really helpful for practicing the queries and using sparks.It told us how to set up from scratch and how to execute the job in specific scenarios.
2.I think the thing that surprised me a lot is when we need to run a subquery in hive we need to assign this a name.Which is quite different from what I've known before(Such as the sql queries).
