I really enjoyed this homework because it seemed to be very useful and applicable to actually performing analyses that the real world would benefit from. I wish we hadn't had homework due during Grace Hopper Celebration because it seemed to sort of penalize those of us who were attending, but even so, I still enjoyed the coding portion a lot and the writeup was pretty good as well.
