I liked Problems 2 and 3 the most out of this assignment. While we have covered a few examples of how MapReduce works in lecture, being able to walk through the steps of Mapping, Grouping & Sorting, and Reducing sample data at my own pace was extremely helpful to my understanding of the concepts. I believe this practice will help me both with implementing MapReduce functions in the future and with my general understanding of the process. The most important thing I learned from this homework assignment is more about some of the advantages and disadvantages of the HDFS standard replication factor and distributed file systems more generally. Having the opportunity to think more deeply about these pros and cons should be helpful to my understanding of future material in addition to understanding when HDFS is likely to be effective and when it is not. Lastly, I was a bit surprised by the fact that Problems 2 and 3 were not too difficult. I expected to struggle more with implementing MapReduce by hand but was pleased to find that I was quite able to implement each of the steps and comprehend how the data would be stored and how it would look at each step.
