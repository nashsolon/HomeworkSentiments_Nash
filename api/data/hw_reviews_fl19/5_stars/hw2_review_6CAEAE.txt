I like the part including hdfs coding. During this assignment, I really get familiar with hadoop command, thanks to your advice which is "Do not copy and paste linux command".
The most important thing I've learnt is the abstruct concept about HDFS on that book. I found it's difficult to learn this just based on a short lecture.
