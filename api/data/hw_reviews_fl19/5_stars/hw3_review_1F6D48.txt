I really enjoyed the third homwework. Each of the questions asked were very relevant to understanding the MapReduce process. I think this is very important so that troubleshooting/debugging is easier sice we are educated on what is happening behind-the-scenes. I think the skew question was also helpful as we did not discuss thi topic in class, but it is very good to know. The most important thing I learned was the whole MapReduce process. I will take this with me in my career. I think it will set me apart from other candidates/workers. I will take this knowledge with me.
