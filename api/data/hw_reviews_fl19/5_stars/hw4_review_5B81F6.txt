This homework was quite intense, since it was the first time we had to code for homework in this class. However, it was worth it because I was able to learn so much by coding instead of just learning about mapreduce through lectures. However, I had hard time coding the partitioner but it was not because it was a hard concept but rather I just forgot how java syntax works. But mostly, it was enjoyable since I just had to sit down and code for most of the time. I think question 2 asked some questions that might help us in the future, since we are going to work more with sentiments of words. It was a great homework since I got to learn how to use mapreduce with toolrunner and add arguments and configuration via command lines. This was much easier than adding them in java files or eclipse configuration. Overall, I think this was a quality homework.
