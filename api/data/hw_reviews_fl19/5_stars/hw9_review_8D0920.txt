What I liked about this homework was that there was a very logical flow to
the way the problems built off on of another. Sometimes with works, the problems
can be scattered in terms of subject material, but for hw 9 we had 3 problems
that were very connected and let me do a deep dive into Spark. I appreciated this
assignment because it made me think in terms of how to practically code, and also
in terms of what's going on behind the scenes for memory placement and efficiency
purposes. 

I would've loved to do more PageRank applications, and think more about that for this
hw too. I think this hw was a great one, so I don't have many complaints and
I think this was a solid hw overall.
