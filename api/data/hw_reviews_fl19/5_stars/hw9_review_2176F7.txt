I like this hw9. It mainly focuses on the Spark, but with two different ways of working. We first practiced with the interactive spark shell, and then wrote a python file to execute program. The most important thing I learned from this homework is DAG (directed acyclic graph). DAG plans for the execution process of Spark. It is really a good way to go through the resolution and understand the problem deeply.
