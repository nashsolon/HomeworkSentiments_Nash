the problems are designed pretty well, especially problem 1.
the question about replication factor make me thinking advantage/disadventage of HDFS. 
my suggestions will be about the lecture, rather than the problems. everytime when it comes to details such as block size and replication factor, i have a feeling of familiarity but not quite get the point. i read the textbook but still have such feeling. i guess only giving examples in lecture is not good enough to tell advantages and disadvantages.
maybe the professor can emphasis some major defferences between hadoop and other products when introducing those technical details. then the advantages and disadvantages of hadoop will be very clear.
