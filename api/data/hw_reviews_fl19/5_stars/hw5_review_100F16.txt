The most important thing I leaned in this assignment is the comparison between different similarity measures for collaborative filtering. Iâ€™m surprised to find out that Pearson correlation is just normalized cosine similarity. I also like implementing the map reduce job for inverted index. It helps deepen my understanding of map reduce workflow and the different types of InputFormat.
