I thoroughly enjoyed this homework assignment because it allowed me to code and do actual analysis on real data using map reduce. I thought it was well designed, an appropriate length, and moderately challenging, as a good homework assignment should be. I hope that all of our future assignments are structured this way. I feel confident in my abilities after this assignment.
