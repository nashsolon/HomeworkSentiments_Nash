I really liked that this assignment was broken up into multiple parts and expanded upon the lab. I like using hive and pyspark a lot and it is a nice switch from java. The most inportant thing I learned is how to use hive and navigate and perform opperations on the data being stored. Also learning how to read the spark documentation to accomplish the tasks at hand was helpful in order to over come any problems or challenges that I face in the future. The last spark question was hard to interpurt, it would be nice to see sample output to make sure we were getting what is expected. In the future I think I would ask any clarifying questions on piaza.
