One thing that surprised me the most was that we are no longer going to use java in this course. Also I was also surprised how easier and faster it was to work with spark and hive to get the data we want instead of using hadoop mapreduce program. However, I think it is quite difficult if you do not know the keyword or make a mistake in the middle of the process since it is quite hard to fix whatever has just been passed to the command line. If I can go back I think I will look at the slide and documentation more before actually working since knowing which keyword is the best in that condition is essential.
