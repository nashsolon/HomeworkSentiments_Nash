I like the assignment 3 very much. Because I learned Linux code in the first question and the overall general concepts of map reduce job execution in the following two questions. And the most important thing I learned in this assignment is the procedures of Hadoop map reduce job execution using the Yarn scheduler, I understood how resource manager, application master, mode manager worked together to complete map reduce jobs, and to my opinion, it is really important in the following studies because only after we had a deep understanding about the procedures, can we replicate it and then write map reduce job code by ourselves in the future.
