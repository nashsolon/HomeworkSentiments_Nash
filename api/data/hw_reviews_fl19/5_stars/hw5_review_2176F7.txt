I like the assignment very much. Because it helps me practice the coding exercise of different output of MapReduce tasks, which is really useful. If I could start over again, I would wrote the code differently for two reasons. First, we do not try the new InputFormat to read the input file as key value pairs. Second, we create a Text() every time, which takes more time and made the program run slowly.
