This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of similarity matrix. I do learn more about different measure to measure similarity through hands on experience with them. I also like the question that ask about how we can improve the jaccard similaritys because that gives some place of application and imagination. Indeed, the measures we have now are never perfect and we should always be looking for a way to improve it.
