This assignment was one of my favorite assignments to date due to a few factors. It was fun working with "real" data and trying to figure out the anomaly rating of the red flash drive. The multiple steps we took to find the reasoning behind bad ratings was engaging and enjoyable. I will say that the Spark aspect was a little bit more abstract for me. If I had to do it over again, I would make sure that I completely understand how to do the labs because I found that the assignments often were variations or builds on top of the lab.
