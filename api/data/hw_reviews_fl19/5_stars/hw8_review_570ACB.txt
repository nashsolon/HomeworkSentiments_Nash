This homework is very meaningful. I learned a lot about spark and hive in doing the homework. I like how it is structured so that latter problems are built on eariler ones, which gives me great satification of completing small tasks that accumulate to be a good practice. I am surprised by the execution speed of Hive and Spark compared to classic Java MR. It makes things a lot easier. Anyways, looking back, I hope I have known sql better before doing the homework.
