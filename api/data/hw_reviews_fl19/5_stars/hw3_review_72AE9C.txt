There is nothing I don't like for this time, all of them greatly reviewed me some of the concepts that was already fading away from my memory. I am really glad that you asked question 3, which maked me dive in google pages and text book a lot to search for any possible resources to get my answer, and I learned a lot during the middle of it. Therefore, I would say the most important thing I learn is about the meaning of YARN and 
its working principle. What superises me is the evolution from MR1 to MR2, I actually admire whoever comes up this idea and how they actually achieved it. Finally, if I could start over again, I would memorized the concept firmly before I get my hands on homework.
