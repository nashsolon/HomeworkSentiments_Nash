From my point of view, I really like this assignment. For the first assignment, I worked on three different type of questions, which enhanced the general concepts of big data characteristics, my probability calculation ability as well as my understanding of the paper given. Second, the whole workload is good to me, I spent a relatively reasonable time on it. The most important thing I learned is the characteristics of big data, we learned the concepts in the class, and in this assignment, I applied the concepts to real examples and I really had a much better understanding on it. As for what surprised me is what I learned from the third problem, according to the paper “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data”, I realized that the amount of data needed when using unlabeled data is much greater than labeled data, and it took much more efforts to retrieve info from unlabeled data. It surprised me a lot and made me know the importance of managing big data in today’s world.
