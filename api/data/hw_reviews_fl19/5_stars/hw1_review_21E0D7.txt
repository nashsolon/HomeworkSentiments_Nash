I enjoyed proposing the type of data types and data structures that would be most useful for storing the different datasets, specifically HTTP logs, text and links of Wikipedia articles, and chemical compounds. However, I wished that the paper had discussed a little bit more about the limitations of the overall data-based approach, rather than just the challenges facing the project on learning from text at web scale. If I could have done the homework assignment differently, I would have not just focused on the easiest data structures to use but would have paid attention to space and time complexity. Something that surprised me was the very large number of people falsely accused of evil-doing.
