I think this homework was great to do because it was so involved with
Hive and spark. I esepcially enjoyed the Hive components because there wasn't
as much setup as typically involved with a map reduce job, but we were still
doing something significant. It required me to think a lot on my feet and to 
think about how best to run queries on a dataset. 

I also enjoyed how there was a story associated with everything we were doing because
it really made me think we were doing some sort of real life task that a data scientist
might do, and these tools that we're using are especially relevant.

The spark part, while still interesting, I didn't like as much because it didn't make
as much sense to me why we were doing what we were doing and also what we were looking at.
I look forward to doing more Spark though because I know it is relevant for the industry
and I enjoy using Python. Perhaps we could use more class or lab time with Spark.
