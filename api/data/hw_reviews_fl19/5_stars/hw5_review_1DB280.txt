This is a very helpful assignment to implement the similarity calculation and understand the properties of them deeply. It's an essential part while building Recommendation Systems. I would like to practice like this more. I hope that the instructions in our homework could be much more clearer than right now, we need to discuss for a long time to understand what's the meaning and if we didn't get the point we'll be deducted the points of homework.
