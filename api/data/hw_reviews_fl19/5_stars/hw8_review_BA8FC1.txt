I do not like how the first problem is described. The instructions somehow are not clear. This problem is not hard, but I spent a long time trying to understand the file format and what to create.

My knowledge about the anonymous function gets enhanced. I have learned or reviewed how to write a lambda function. I think this is an essential skill for a programmer or data analyst. The code looks much cleaner and easy to read. The expression becomes more elegant and efficient.
