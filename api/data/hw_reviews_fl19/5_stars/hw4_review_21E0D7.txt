I definitely enjoyed building my own partitioner and being able to see how that creates a more organizedreduce output based on what we plan to do with it afterward. The most important thing that I learned is probably this as well, that using a partitioner could create different reducer file outputs, making it much easier for us to conduct analyses on these outputs later. If I could start over again, I would have actually done the lab 4 before this, since there was a lot of information from that lab that would have been useful in this homework assignment. Something I did not like about the asignment is that running the jar file on the hadoop cluster took a very large amount of time
