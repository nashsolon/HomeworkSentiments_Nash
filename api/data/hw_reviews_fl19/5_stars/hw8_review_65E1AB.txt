I really liked that we stepped away from Java and vanilla Hadoop to finally work with more industry-adopted tools. I especially enjoyed working with Spark as I know it’s what’s been most widely adopted in the industry. The length of time it takes for Hive to execute jobs surprised me quite a bit. Although it’s easier to write queries than creating Java jars, it still takes equally as long.
