I liked this assignment because I got to understand and calculate the jaccard similarity veruses the sodine similarity and normalizing. I had fun doing that. The textbbook was very helpful with understanding the problems because it gave examples of how to solve it compared to the slides. I found problem 3 a bit tough to understand just because it says to prove formally. I wasn't sure how to do it properly so it caused some frustration.
