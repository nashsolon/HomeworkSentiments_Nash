For me, hw1 is a good experience as a beginning of this course.I like this assignment because of the choosing of problem types, one about course ppt we just learned, one about reference book, one about a short paper. I think this is a reasonale distribution. The most important thing I learned is the 5 characteristics of big data, thanks to problem 1. To be honest, this bonus refelection surprised me, I had some thoughts about assignments before for other course, but just in a few moment after I finished them, so this txt is a good oppotunity for us to record our thoughts about homeworks. If I were gonna start this assignment again, I would do problem 3 first, which would give me a deeper understanding of big data and hopefully make it easier to do others.
