I liked that this assignment helped me better understand YARN, this is the most important thing I learned from the assignment. I also better learned how skew can happen and what tends to increase skew. The assignment integrated well with the assigned reading. I disliked that I had to look in various places to find the answer, and I wish the assignment had more visuals to refer to.
