I like the coding part in this homework, finally we have a coding homework for us to work on I am so excited. All we were talking about were concepts in class and I'm longing for this coding for two whole weeks. Coding really gives me how model works, I also learnt some of the Java skills that were new to me. The part that surprises me is such a complicated system of model can actually be coded in this small scale. I thought it took hundreds of thousands of lines of code to implement. One thing I'm a little working about is the insufficiency of me to completely understand the whole code, I mean I get what I implemented, but for the whole thing I'm still confused at some point. Finally, if I would start over again, I would start earlier because the schedule this week was too intense.
