• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
What I like about the assignment is that I get the hands-on experience on how to implement ToolRunner and Partitioner.
• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
After finishing the homework I have a better understanding of ToolRunner and partitioner and how to specify configuration file in the command line.
• What surprised you, and why?
ToolRunner is super useful, powerful and flexible. We could use it to test different configurations.
