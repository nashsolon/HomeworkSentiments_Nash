I really enjoyed getting to implement word co-occurrence in order. In addition, I greatly enjoyed building my own MapReduce framework with the aggregate ratings and top n list. What I did not like was again the difficulty of testing the program on the hadoop cluster, both in terms of long runtimes and difficulty in debugging. If I could start again on this assignment, I would code even more incrementally than what I did, I think I tried coding incrementally, but only tested on the smallest of inputs, I would have tried to pull a tiny subset of data and maybe even used unit tests. The most important thing we learned was probably how to make more efficient programs in terms of communication costs.
