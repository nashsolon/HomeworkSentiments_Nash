I like this assignment very much, for that it covers all kinds of tasks from coding, analysis and computation. All of these tasks are quite challenging and inspires me to think about the main idea of Hadoop carefully. The most important thing I learned from hw6 is the usage of sort comparator and group comparator. The sort comparator does the sorting, while the group comparator processes the data for each group. The two class both help relieve the workload of the reducer and implement additional functions.
