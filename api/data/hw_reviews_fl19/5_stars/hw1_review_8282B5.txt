\f0\fs20 \cf0 What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?\
\
I think the assignment has a close relationship with the lecture, and it\'92s helpful to deepen our understandings, especially for the problem1-Big Data Characteristics.\
\
What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?\
\
The most important thing I learned is that when we choose an algorithm to analyze the data, we need to put its limits into consideration, just like the last question of problem 3.}
