I like this assignment because it requires extra reading for the basic knowledge of HDFS. The most important thing I learn is the HDFS and the operation behind the system. One thing really surprised me that the original data will be replicated 3 times (default setting) and stored on different racks in case of node failure. Before this class, I have no idea how the HDFS stores its data and secure it.
