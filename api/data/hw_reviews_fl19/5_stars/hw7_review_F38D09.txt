This homework assignment is really good. I get to know a little bit more about the combiner. I almost forgot what a combiner is hahaha! I also liked the top-N list question.  I like how we needed to write everything from the scratch. It was really helpful that the professor gave us an example with starter codes. If without those resources, I may have to spend much more and more time on that question. The third question regarding the "stripes" was not that easy for me.
