I like hw9 as it introduces how I should write and run python program using pyspark, as well as in different modes. It also allows me to see how these modes are different. However, I would like to have more practice with pagerank as I am still not quite familiar with the algorithm. I am surprised by how easily written python is comparing to java, not mentioning c, and how much I still need to catch up with python. Also I learnt difference between map and flatMap, the hard way.
