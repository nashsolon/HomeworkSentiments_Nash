1.I like this assignment because it is really challenging, especially for the coding parts. It provides me with a futher understanding of how MapReducer works and JAVA implementation. 

2.I am suprised that our first coding assignment is really complicated. The question itself is fair but it takes me much time to debug. 

4.I would re-do the lab 3 and review my JAVA programming knowledge because some of the materials/questions in this assignment are really high-level thinking and requires strong base JAVA coding skill.
