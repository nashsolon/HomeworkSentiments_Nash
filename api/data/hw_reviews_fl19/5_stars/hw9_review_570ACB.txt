I liked this assignment. I started the assignment too late. I didn't have time to finish it. Iam pretty comfortable with all the concepts and spark operations. Most of them are pretty intuitive given that we have already practiced mapReduce for a solid amount of time. I was surprised by how I can get stuck at one thing and not be able to move on for a long time. I got stuck on problem 2 question d for like half an hour and decided to come back to it later, which I never did. sigh.
