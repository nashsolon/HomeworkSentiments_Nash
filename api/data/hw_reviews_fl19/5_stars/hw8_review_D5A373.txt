For this assignment, I like the problem 2 and 3. This problem helps me a lot to understand how to use the SQL in the HIVE. I used to think is should be almost the same as the traditional SQL Queries in Mysql database.Indeed, they are similar, but after doing this assignment, I understand that the queries in Hive are kind of more suitable Hadoop.

If I could start over again, I would ask TA earlier to get some help.
Also, I would like to read the book before starting the homework.
