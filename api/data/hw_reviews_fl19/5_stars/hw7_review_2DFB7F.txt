• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I've learnt how to implement top-N-list, word co-occurrence,and Combiner's effect on top-N-List.

• What surprised you, and why?
Compared to past homework, this homework is more difficult and time consuming, the good thing is that we're given enough for to finish it.

• Assumingyoucouldstartoveragain(withworkingontheassignment),whatwould you do differently and why?
Labs are very important, I would go over Lab one more time so I could be more efficient on finishing the homework.
