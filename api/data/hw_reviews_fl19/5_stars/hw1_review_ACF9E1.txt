1.I like the assignment because it provide me a chance to read papers and get more knowledge about this field. Also it serves as a revision of what we learnt in class.
2.I think for me the most important thing is that I learnt an important rule in the paper:  simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data. Because in future I will have many chances to deal with data issues, and choosing an efficient way will be of vital importance.
3.I was surprised by the truth that wikipedia articles can also be considered as big data, because in my mind itâ€™s not a typical dataset.
4. I will read the paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data more thoroghly, because it give me a clear outline of the data analysis process.
