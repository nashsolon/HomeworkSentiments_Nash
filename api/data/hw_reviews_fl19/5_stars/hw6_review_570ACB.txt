I like this assignment. It may be my favourite assignment so far. The reason being that it has a lot of hands-on programming exercises. I like coding more than answering questions like "Why do you think this is more efficient?" That's just me. I learned a lot about secondary sort. Quite useful. Nothing was too surprising because all of it was covered in lecture. If I can start again, I will start  the assignment eariler. It took longer than I expected.
