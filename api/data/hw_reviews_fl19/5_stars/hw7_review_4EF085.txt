This homework was excellent in a sense of coding practice. Since we had to start from the scratch every java programs for job 1 and job 2, it was a nice recap of previous practices.  Also, it was a good opportunity to see the work of combiner and practice how to utilize hadoop commands. I hope to have a chance to program a better version to examine co-occurance. Overall, it was another fun homework due to a lot of coding practices.
