This homework contains comparators, secondary sort and collaborative filtering. I like this homework a lot, because it helps me in solving more complicated problems. I am surprised by the benefits of using secondary sort (more scalable than a naive solution). But the coding is not hard in general. Also, for the problem2(b), I am curious about how to achieve the goal of avoiding skew.
