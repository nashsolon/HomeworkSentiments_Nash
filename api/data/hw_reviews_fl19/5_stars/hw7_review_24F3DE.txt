I really enjoyed this assignment. This was my favorite assignment out of all the assignments we have done. I loved that we got to work with Netflix's real data, and I thought it was a fun challenge to try to figure out the best way to build a map reduce job to get the top n movies. I wish I knew more about the stripes method, but I hope we get to implement one in the future. For next time I want to make sure I know all the ports that need to be exposed, because I had to rebuild image to allow for the job manager to be seen in the web ui. Overall good assignment.
