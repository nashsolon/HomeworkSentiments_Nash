1. I like the assignment very much. From the homework I learned tranforming data in Spark using Spark, joining datasets in SPARK and writing a SPARK program. 
2. The most important thing I have learned is to use flume and master yarn to do the spark work.
3. The working time surprised me a lot.
4. I will do this homework a little bit earlier.
