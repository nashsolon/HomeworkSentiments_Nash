As always, I like homeworks that consists more coding than solving problems. I really learned  a lot when I implemented the StringPairWritable. Also I realized how I could implement the toCompare method to make them globally sort as the output. It was very interesting to find out how one more number, which was negative 1, could affect the outcome.

Secondly, if I could start over this assignment again. I would start using without the StringPairWritable. I would love to see what StringPairWritable provides us in comfort.
