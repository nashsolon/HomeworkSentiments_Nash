• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
After finishing this homework, I've learnt how YARN works， the concept of skew and what we can do to reduce the impact of skew，why HADOOP executes data locally.

•Assuming you could start over again(with working on the assignment),what would you do differently and why?
I'll read the book Mining of Massive Datasets more carefully so I would be able to solve the questions more efficiently.
