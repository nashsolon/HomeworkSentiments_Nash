By far this is my favorite homework, I like the combination of code part and the calculation part. I like how you make me practice how to code then use examples of Jaccard similarity and cosine similarity to let me review what the process is. Therefore I have to go in to the book to take a look at the original example to get familiar with the calculation process, which is helpful. The most important thing I have learnt from this homework is biased opinion	from people are unavoidable, so I have to be careful when dealing with data. The surprising part about this homework is there are actually tutorials about how to implement Jaccard and cosine similarities in python and java, which I would definitely do if I get a chance to start over again, because doing the calculation by hand is simply time consuming.
