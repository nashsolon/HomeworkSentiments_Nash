This homework was very well constucted in terms of giving the students the opportunity to look into the fundamentals of how the Hadoop 2 executes MapReduce with its daemons. The hypothetical questions of 100 to 10000 Reduce tasks provides a spectrum of variation of how much tasks should be made in order to most efficiently carry out the MapReduce jobs. Question 3 also provides a good opportunity for us to walk through the process of Hadoop 2. In overall, the homework was a good review of what we learned in class.
