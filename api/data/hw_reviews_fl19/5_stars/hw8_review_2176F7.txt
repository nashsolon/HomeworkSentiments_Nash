This hw8 is pretty good. I really like it. In this homework, I practiced the use of Hive and Spark. On the Hive part, we exercised on the operations of creating table, loading data and making queries. On the Spark part, we strengthened the understanding on pipeline operations and worked on a practical problem. The most important thing I learned from hw8 is the file-based input format and the file-based output format. Because it is quite different from the line-based format.
