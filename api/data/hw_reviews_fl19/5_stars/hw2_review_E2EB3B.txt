I like the example of mapreduce in this hw, solid example helps me remember concepts.
The most important thing I learned from this hw is from the HTDG book about merits and drawbacks of HDFS. reading HTDG is much more fun than the last article.
there's nothing really suprised me. Everything tested is lecture content relatedand presented in a very good way.

if starting over i woud focus more on the concept part, replication factor and block size explanation see if what i understand differs much from the ref book explanation.
