I liked this lab because the instructions were much clearer than previous homeworks and it was easier to understand what was being asked for. It was interesting to learn how to turn a rating data into boolean values so Jaccard similarity measure can be used. I also previously did not notice that Pearson's correlation coefficient was just normailized cosine similarity. That was both surprising and interesting.
