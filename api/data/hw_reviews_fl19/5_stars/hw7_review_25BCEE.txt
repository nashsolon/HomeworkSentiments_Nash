I enjoyed this homework because it mostly involved implementing mapreduce. In addition, I enjoyed analyzing Netflix data. The data itself and the results were interesting to analyze. If I could restart again, I would be dilligent about working with test data and testing incrementally. A lot of time could have been saved if I was simply careful with writing the mapreduce programs. Overall, the assignment was enjoyable though and looking forward to analyzing more BIG data.
