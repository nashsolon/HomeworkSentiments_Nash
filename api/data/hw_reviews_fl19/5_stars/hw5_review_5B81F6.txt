One of the hardest part of this homework was finding Cosine similarity of the data. In the lecture we went over the calculations but I could not understand the concept of cosine similarity. Then while doing the homework I realized that thiscalculation was similar to that of variance. The reason that we use variance was to remove any extremity. I believe that a similar approach was used in cosine similarity in that we get variance in denominator to reduce extremity in calculation. Another thing that I learned was that cosine similarity cares about scales when Jaccard does not. When I understood this, homework became pretty easy. Coding part was quite similar to previous ones, so it was quite doable.
