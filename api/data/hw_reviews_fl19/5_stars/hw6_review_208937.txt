I really like this assignment. Basically for two reasons: For the first two problems, I tried to write stringpairwritable.java and used it when running mapreduce jobs. This is the first time I write it by myself instead of using default functions in java. And then I encountered problems when I run the job. I tried to figure out where the problem is and aft first I thought it was I had the wrong reducer function. And after I looked through questions in piazza, then I realized the problem was not in reducer, it was in my stringpairwritable. From this, I learned that when writing the code, every detail will affect the final result, and we have to dig deeper to see where the problem really is in and do not focus on the last step ahead of the problem. Second, I wrote the answers of problem 3 manually and then I went through all the process of collaborative filtering and had an enhanced understanding regarding the concepts.
If I had the chance to do the assignment again, I will tell myself to think about the whole picture of problem1's code when I encountered the bug. Because as I wrote above, I learned that every detail in coding is important to the final result, hence if there occurs a problem, there may be a bug in several steps ahead. We should try to solve problems with a general picture, not a cluster of coding files.
