I like this homework very much, because it combines coding work and analytical work in every problem for this hw7. The most important thing I learned from this homework is the deep understanding on communication cost and the comparison between pairs and stripes. Through the specific case in the problem3, I applied the knowledge learned from the lecture and gained more insight.
