I believe this is the worst hw i have ever had. If Professor Neumann could have told us that the homework consists of workload of two weeks, I would have begun it much earlier. Moreover, this lab has loads of confusing instructions, which forces me to go over everything again and again. Therefore, I would say this one is probably going to be the worst one. I hope more clarifications would be given if possible.
