The experience of finishing this homework is generally great. The part I like the most is that this homework takes both qualitative and quantitive problem into consideration and hopefully it could also consider some coding problem. And, though doing this homework, reading "The unreasonable effectiveness of data" actually, I got to know the power of using statistically model in NLP problem and feed data to algorithm and let them to capture relationship automatically, this thing really suprised my a lot. Thanks
