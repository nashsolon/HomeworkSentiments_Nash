I am just tired of writing reflection, this home work is ok, it is related to the final project, and it's not too hard \, while not too easy. through the entire homework, I learned how to deal data , manipulate data ,transform them into different forms, which is quite interesting.I like this homework because it is well-designed, especially problem2. In order to finish  problem 2, I have to carefully went through the lab, and understand what happened in every step. Other than that, the problem also ask to implement some modifications to optimize the map-reduce job, I can only finish the modifications after completely understand how the program works. Except Problem2, other problems are also inspiring and challenging, I feel like those problems really helped me to understand the map reduce process deeply.
