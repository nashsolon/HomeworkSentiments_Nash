I like this homework, since it contains the knowledge we have learned in class. We got a chance to practice coding and practical skills. The toolrunner question is extremely useful since it gave us a chance to explore real map-reduce job under different parameters. One thing I don't really like is that I'm confused by the Problem 1(b) and (c)at first. The question is quite unclear .
