STAR RATING(4* out of 5*) I like the part where we have to list the advantage and disadvantage. This part of knowledge is an enhancement of how the HDFS is designed. As now, may company like test about system design when interviewing, and konwing the demanding and corresponding solution is good. However, I think there is also may unclear part in the quesiton of this homework.For example, problem, the mapper output according to the function looks strange and did not if a shuffler would involve in this process or not.
