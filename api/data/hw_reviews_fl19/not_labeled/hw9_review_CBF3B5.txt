I thought the first few problems of this homework were very similar to the last homework. I liked that I felt comfortable doing the problem, but I don't really feel like I learned a lot. I thought problems 3 and 4 were a little more challenging and were very different from the first two questions. Overall, I donâ€™t feel like I gained as much from this homework as I have from other homework. Rate 3 stars.
