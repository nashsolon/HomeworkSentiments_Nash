• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why? 
It helps me to get familiar to other part of MR program, which is very helpful.

• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
How to modify comparators and partitioner.

• What surprised you, and why?
The MR frame can do so many things itself, like partition, with only a little work on configuration.

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would
you do differently and why?
I’ll think about the Q3 more thoroughly.
