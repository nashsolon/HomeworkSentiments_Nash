Homework 7 is actually challenging for me because it is the first time I write a map reduce job complete on my own, I have to design the map reduce structure on my own, It. Is more challenging than before. This homework also contains knowledge of previous homework, some I have forgot and had to went over previous homework again, it is also a good way to review. Another reason I like this homework is that the third problem is designed to let me design my own map reduce job process step by step, it hives enough hint, which is just enough for me to make it, It is quite inspiring to finish the home work.
