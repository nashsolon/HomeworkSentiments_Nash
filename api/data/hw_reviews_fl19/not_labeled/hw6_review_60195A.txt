I like this homework because it is well-designed, especially problem2. In order to finish  problem 2, I have to carefully went through the lab, and understand what happened in every step. Other than that, the problem also ask to implement some modifications to optimize the map-reduce job, I can only finish the modifications after completely understand how the program works. Except Problem2, other problems are also inspiring and challenging, I feel like those problems really helped me to understand the map reduce process deeply.
