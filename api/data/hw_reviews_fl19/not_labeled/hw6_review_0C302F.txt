This homework was pretty good. I liked how we did a problem in lab that was the same as problem 3. I understood the problem better because it was done in lab once. The problem I found to be more difficult was problem 2, because when I removed the argument, the output wasn't correct. It took my partner and I a while to figure it out. Overall, I liked this homework.
