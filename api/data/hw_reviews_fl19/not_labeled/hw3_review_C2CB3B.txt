I liked that the first homework question required some amount of technical work. I dislike questions that require reading instead of work with the VM. Questions like 3b require that we search sections of the reading that pertain to the question (disliked), while questions like 2a tell us which sections to look into (liked). The most important things that I got out fo this project was practice working with the VM. If I could write the homework, it would be all VM work, and no textbook theory. I find the former much more helpful.
