I kind feel relieved for this homework beacuse this home work doesn't invlove java MapReduce programming, instead, We are dealing with actual business problem here. The home work is designed beginner friendly ,the first few problem are just to lart you catch up with HiveSQL basics such as create tables, do some simple queries and business analysis,etc.
After the query questions cames the bigdeal: spark problems. For those problems My feelng was they are more complete than previous questions.Spark is obviously more powerful tool for sure, we could do bi-gram tri-gram analysis with a single line (instead hundreds lines of java code), and get the exact result we want. After finishing this homework, I deel like a would actually do something in reallife
