1. I like it! Because problem1 gives me chance to try harder question instead of just copying the code from slides. P2 and P3 let me solid my knowledge in COLLABORATIVE FILTERING and recommond system.
2. Knowing what are you coding for. Because this can help us solve the problem that we do not meet before.
3. Math is hard!
4. Study Math harder. TAT
