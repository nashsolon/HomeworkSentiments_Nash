â€¢ What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
Problem 1 and 2 are good, which can directly reflects the content in class. However, prob 3 is not as good as the other two, because the answer is a kind of unclear for me.

I got better understanding of the characteristics of of big data And after the first week study, I got primary familliar and with VM, which I had never used before.

 Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?
Reading the paper frustrated me, because I am not expertise on this field, there are so many things I had never learned. I spend much more time to fully understanding the paper than I expected.
