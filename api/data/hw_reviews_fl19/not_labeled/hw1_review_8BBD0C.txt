One of the things I liked about this assignment was the first problem where i was able to get a good grasp of the characteristics truly needed for big data applications.
I thought that the article however was quite dense and not as useful in the long run in helping me learn about big data. 
The second problem also felt slightly out of place with the other two problems.
