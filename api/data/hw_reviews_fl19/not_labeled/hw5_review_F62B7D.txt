• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why? 
It is rather interesting to do this assignment since there’re many kinds of different problems for me to think about. What I dislike is the problem 3a. I am really confused about the description. The equation is too obvious and I could find no way to “show formally”.

• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
The getPath().getName() method. Without the hint and implementation in this assignment I might never find this usage.

• What surprised you, and why?
The interesting result of different similarity calculations.

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would
you do differently and why?
I’ll use program to calculate the tings in problem 2 for me.
