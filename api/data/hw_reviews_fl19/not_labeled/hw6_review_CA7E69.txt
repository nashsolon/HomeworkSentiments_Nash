I'm quite comfortable with this assignment. Although the output format of writable class stuck me some of time. It give me experience of how to using writable classes as well as secondary sort. Also, the problem 3 is interesting. It lead me to dig into the algorithm of collaborative filtering. When I first try, I'm not sure if I get those answer correct. But as I'm going through the problem, I'm quite sure as long as I following the algorithm in lecture slides, I could get the correct answer.
