This homework was a good mix of either styles of homework. I found the implementation problems very helpful; I still believe they are the best wway to learn the material. While I found some of the questions related to the implementation very difficult, like 3d and 2b, I still liked them better than questions on readings; these were the types of problems that most surprised me about this hw.
