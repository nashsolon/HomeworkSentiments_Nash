The problem 3 is a time-consuming question. Although the code is easy to write, the edge case should be considered. At first, there's no "vervna,Julia" in my output. I spent a long time to find "verona" in original input and found no result. Finally, I realized that I didn't convert word in lower case. What's more, I gained insight of job counter. In the job counter part, there're "File input" and "HDFS file input". At first, I was confused by these two definition. Then, I figured out that "File input" may be the intermediate result like group&sort result. The last question of Problem3 is good, I was forced to figure out the stripe verson word_count example so that I can get a better understanding of what're m, l in the formula.
