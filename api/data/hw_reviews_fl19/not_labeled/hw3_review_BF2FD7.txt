What is the most important thing I learned and why I think so:
Through the assignment, I have found out some of my misunderstandings about the topics from lecture, and corrected them immediately. And, the assignment also help me to review the knowledge from lecture and have a deeper understanding of them.

Assuming I could start over again, what would I do differently:
I think I would first review the slides and read the paper carefully first, since most of the answers of questions are directly coming from these resources, so first going through the resources can save my time a lot.
