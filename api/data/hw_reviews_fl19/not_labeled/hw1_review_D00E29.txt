This assignment was intriguing. I appreciated the fact that it directly related to the lecture material, while providing opportunities to think through the assignment. I think at first, problem 2 was confusing, and I wish problem 3 related more to what we talked about in lecture. That being said, I think it is a very good approach to have a real life example of the use of big data in our assignments. I hope we have such examples in the other homework. I think next time, I would have read the book sections first to gain even more insights, followed by re-reading the posted lecture notes as well as my own notes before even looking at the problems.
