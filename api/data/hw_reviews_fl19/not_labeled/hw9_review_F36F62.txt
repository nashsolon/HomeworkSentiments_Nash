I’m surprised that there are so many ways to count the number of results generated by “groupByKey” method. I’ve seen 3 ways to do it. I use the method I learned from the official documentation.
I will double check the data from lab8 more carefully. Again, I had problems with dataset. I will regenerate the data before I start this homework.
