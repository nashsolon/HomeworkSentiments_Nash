1.I like this assignment because it helps me deepen my understanding of the map reduce program and the knowledge about secondary sort.
2.I think the most important thing I learn is how to write and use my own customed writables.I think it's really useful because we may face many situations that need us to use our own writable class.
3.I was surprised by the fact that we can use a hashCode() function to generate the hashcode for each StringPairWrittable object.
