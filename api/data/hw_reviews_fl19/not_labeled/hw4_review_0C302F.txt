In hw4, I like that I got the chance to understand the code from lab. I also like that I got to get to know new topics covered in class. I now feel that I understand more about what a driver does in relation to a mapper and reducer. I most important thing I learned is that case shouldn't matter and words don't all have the correct sentiment value because it all depends on the context of where the data is from. Like the phrase not happy would be neutral and positive but the meaning is negative.
