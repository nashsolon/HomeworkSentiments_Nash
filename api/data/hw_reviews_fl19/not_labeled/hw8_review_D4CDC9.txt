This homework was definitely on the upper end of difficulty. I found that the documentation for Hive was pretty awful while that for Spark was a little bit better. Question 2 was pretty unlike anything we had done in class, which made it very, very difficult. I'm not sure why Question 5 was worth so many points, as it seemed easier than question 2. Overall, the assignment did further my knowledge of Spark and Hive, which was good.
