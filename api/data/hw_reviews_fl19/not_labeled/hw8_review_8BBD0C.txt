Overall, i did not like this assignment. The thing i disliked the most about this assignment was how there was very little guidance or instruction related to what we needed to do. Some of the instructions, particularly for problem 3 were also incorrect. One thing that surprised me was also how much the assignment covered, both hive and spark. I think it should have been split up into two assignments.
