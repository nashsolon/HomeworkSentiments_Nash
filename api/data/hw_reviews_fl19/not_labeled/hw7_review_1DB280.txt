This homework is the most interesting one I've had since I took this course. While there's some trouble I've met since my VirtualBox was shut down accidentally and everything was gone, but we finally made it work. And I've learnt more about the nexflix prizes and get more information about recommendation systems. The word occurrence one is interesting too cuz when I'm trying to make examples to show that bi-gram is not that efficiency, I re-read All's Well that End's Well one more time and it reminded me good old days.
