What I liked about this homework is that it felt well-organized and the questions were well-worded and made sense.
The workload was just right, and it blended coding for practical purposes as well as doing calulcations
by hand. It made me think about which approaches were most effective and why.

There's not really anything that I did not like about this homework. I would like to dive deeper into
the collaborative filtering, and which use cases are more effective for certain reasons. 
I also felt I could have coded one of the approaches from the given pseudocode on the slides.
