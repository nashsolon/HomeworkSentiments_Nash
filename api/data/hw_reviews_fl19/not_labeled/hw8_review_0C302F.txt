I really enjoyed this homework assignment. It was a little bit easier than the previous homework. I had a fun time doing it. I got to understand that the order of the keywords in the query makes a difference. I also learned that in hive results are default to be in ascending order. I like that I got a little bit more familiar with spark in this assignment. I was still a bit confused after lab. Overall, funnest assignment yet.
