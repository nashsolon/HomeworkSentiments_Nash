I really liked that this assignment built off the lab. I felt like this assignment was a lot more hands on. I liked the problems and how they related to the readings. The last two questions were a little bit hard to interpurt it would have been nice to see one example of what was expected on those type of problems. If I could start the assignment over I would probably try to ask more questions on Piazza in order to clarify the questions.
