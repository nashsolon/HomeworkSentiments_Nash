For this homework, I found that most of the questions were difficult to answer first. I wasn't quite sure how to answer much of the question with purely the textbook and I needed to look at many other sources. For example, information about the YARN scheduler and its daemons were not easily found in the textbook. My favorite part of the homework was the problems involving using hadoop commands to get different values. It is nice to have a hands-on portion of the homework. I felt that the problem involving sentiment was a little out of left-field and felt like I wasn't really equipped to answer that question
