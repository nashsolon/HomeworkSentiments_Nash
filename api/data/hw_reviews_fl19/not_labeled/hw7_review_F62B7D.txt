• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why? 
The tasks are interesting. I like reusing things like SumReducer.

• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
How to use Yarn to check the job statistics.

• What surprised you, and why?
The word co-occurrence job keeps reporting error and I couldn’t find why. Finally I found that I had done everything right but imported a wrong Text class.

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would
you do differently and why?
Come up with an example where we can’t use reducer as combiner.
