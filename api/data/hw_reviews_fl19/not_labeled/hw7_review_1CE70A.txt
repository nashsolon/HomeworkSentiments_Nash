This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of Top-N Lists and word co-occurrence. I do learn more about the general procedure of Top-N lists and how to implement a word co-occurrence method, etc. I also like the question that ask about the difference between Stripes and Pairs and to calculate memory requirements and communication cost. It tells about how we have probably many choices of methods in the real world and we have to choose between them.
