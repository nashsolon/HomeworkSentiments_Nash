RATING(3* out of 5*) The homework generally is helpful and has a comprehensive coverage. However, I fell some question are too abstract or vague for me to write down a solid 'correct' answer. For example I really do not know which model is the data-based model as all models talked in the article are required to be justed based on model, however on a different level. I just want the question of the homework to be more clear. The settings and other parts are good.
