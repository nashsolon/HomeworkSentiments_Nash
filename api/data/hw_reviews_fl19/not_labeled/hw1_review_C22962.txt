I really like this homework. Even though it has many reading, I can obtain lots of information about Big Data from the reading. It is a good resource for me to better understand the definition we talked in class. The most important thing I think that is the characteristic for Big data. I am very surprised by the application of using Big Data. I cannot imagine there are many methods and approaches to apply the Big Data in people's lives. I will go over all lecture information before starting the homework. Many answers in the homework are the information we talked in class.
