One thing I liked about this assignment is that we get to use multiple jobs to get a result that better helped me understand the MR workflow involving more than one job. I thought the third question relating to communication costs was rather vague in what it was asking for and I think improvements can be made there.

I feel like I don't understand some of the theory behind all of this and if I were to redo this lab I would first go back to the slides and do a thorough review
