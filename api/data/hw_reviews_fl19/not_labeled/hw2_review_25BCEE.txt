This homework went more smoothly than the last. I think it was really good practice running through mapreduce. In addition, drawing the cluster was also helpful in reinforcing what went over in class. Some parts that I thought were difficult were the questions about advantages and disadvantages of certain features of HDFS. I felt the need to look at online resources to help me answer the question and maybe it's good because I learned a lot of content that wasn't learned in class. If I got to start over again, I would probably have been a little more careful with reading the instructions because I read instructions incorrectly the first time for the reduce task.
