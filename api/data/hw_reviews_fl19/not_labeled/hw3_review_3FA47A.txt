The experience of finishing this week's homework is generally smooth and happy. The part I like most is the problem one, which is able to let us to use hadoop in real problem solving senario and analyze the result. The most important thing I learned from the homework is that even for a advanced distributed computation framework, it still needs its user to deeply understant its pros and cons and even the structure to make it ultimately useful.
