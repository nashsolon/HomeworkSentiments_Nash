This assignment is nearly all about coding, which is what I like about this assignment. It lets me review the concept and coding skills. One small thing I dislike about this assignment is it's probably too long. The most important thing this assignment gave me is it lets me to go over lambda function over and over and over again, which I think it's the fundamental of Spark. One thing that surprises me is again, the flexibility that lambda function can attract from raw information. If I could start again, I would definitely go to office hours to figure out more about lambda function.
