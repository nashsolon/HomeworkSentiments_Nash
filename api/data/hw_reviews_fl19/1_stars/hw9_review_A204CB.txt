I feel I am going to crash. Three meetings in three days, each of them needs my reseach results. And then I found I still have a homework to do and without understanding of some part of it. I just answered some of them. In total I feel painful for cloud computing homeworks. One reason is that there are too many things to look at. Usually 50 to 80 pages of slides, one lab and one homework each week, and two books I do not have time to scan. I am not sure if I can really remember anything for the course.
