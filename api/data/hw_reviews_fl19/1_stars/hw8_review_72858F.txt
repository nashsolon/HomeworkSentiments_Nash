1. I do not like the assignment. It is too much and costs me such a lot of time to deal with. I feel really stressed about it.
2. I learned a lot about Hive and Spark in this assignment. Like creating, altering, searching operations in talbes.
3. The level of homework surprieds me a lot. It is so hard for me.
4. I will discuss some problems with TAs and my classmates when I met some difficulty.
