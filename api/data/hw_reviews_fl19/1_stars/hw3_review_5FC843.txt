Overall I did not like this hw assignment. It was very technical and theoretical. I know that its important to know these concepts but I feel like I learn better by coding or applying. I dont know if its possible to understand scheduling and job execution by practicing since your computer just handles it. Overall I wish HW was just graded for participation not accuracy but we still get feedback so we learn. I liked the first problem because we actually got to run commands and think about how to count all the key value pairs. It felt more like a puzzle and we didn't really need to refer to the textbook. The third problem was my least favorite since it was laborious to describe the technical details. This was the most difficult hw thus far and it caught me off guard.
