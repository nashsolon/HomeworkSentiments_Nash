What did you like / dislike about the assignment and why? 
The topic was very interesting I learned a lot from solving the questions. However, the fact that there is no right or wrong answer makes me very confused. Problem 1 was fine since we had a criteria to make a decision. But problem 3 was a little challenging. 

What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so? 
The ability to determine which data is considered as huge and complex since this is what I will be doing in the rest of the course.
