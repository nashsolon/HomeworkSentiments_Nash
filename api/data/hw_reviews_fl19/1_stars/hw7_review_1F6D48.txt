I thought that this homework was very challenging. We had a lot of problems with our virtual machines, which was not fun to deal with. However, it was nice to do something practical like work with Netflix data. If I were to redo this, I would start earlier and resolve virtual machine issues. Overall, it was a learning experience but not one I would like to do again.
