I would say this is one of the most difficult labs I have ever had this semsester. The past ones were not that easy but managable because finding an appropriate after looking through the textbooks and materials would help a lot, but this one is undoubtedly more difficult and have caused me loads of problem. I wish I could have more time on reasoning why thigns would work, though.
