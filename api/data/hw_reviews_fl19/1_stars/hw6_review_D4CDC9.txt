To be honest, I was not a fan of this assignment. I think one of the biggest issues I had was with problem 2.a.ii, where the question was poorly written to start and furthermore seems to have forgotten that in-place O(n log n) sorting exists. Furthermore, question 3, where you had to do a map reduce job by hand was incredibly tedious. The entire reason we have computers is so that we don't have to do these sorts of tedious tasks. Overall, this was my second to least homework so far, after homework 1.
