I really enjoyed this homework assignment. I felt like this was the first time I actually got my hands into the weeds of how cloud computing actually worked. I found it particularly challenging to explain YARN effectively. It didn't really make a lot of sense to me but I will work on understanding it better. I did feel like this homework assignment was a bit of regurgitation of slides/stuff in the textbook, which is fine but I am unsure if i actually know what's going on. (I spent a lot of this assignment paraphrasing stuff from slides etc.
