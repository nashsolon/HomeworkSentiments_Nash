I disliked this assignment a lot because I felt that many of the questions were extremely unclear in their wording and general structure. For example, problem two on skew took a textbook problem that made a lot of sense and transformed it into an extremely confusing, poorly worded question that in fact used many of the terms we were suggested not to use such as 'Reduce task.' Additionally, we did not actually discuss Combiners or skew in class until after the homework assignment was due. Also, problem three on Job Execution was even more confusing as we did not discuss YARN at all in class, and the two sub-questions were extremely poorly phrased so that they did not correlate with any of the actual material. For example, asking us to describe job execution using the YARN scheduler was an awful question as the textbook offers three different methods of job execution, but allegedely the answer desired had nothing to do with those methods. I was surprised by how poorly worded these questions were and how unnecessarily unclear they were, and I hope future homeworks are more clear and accurate about what answers they seek so as to not cause unnecessary, unproductive confusion.
