This homework was definitely more challenging than ever, for honestly ridiculous reasons. I spent too much time trying to make my code run on hadoop, while it ran perfectly fine on eclipse. Therefore we could not go on and work on part of problem 2. Problem 3, the word-co-occurrence, however, was pretty reasonable. Overall, the questions served as a good review excercises for writing mapreduce jobs before we moved onto next topics.
