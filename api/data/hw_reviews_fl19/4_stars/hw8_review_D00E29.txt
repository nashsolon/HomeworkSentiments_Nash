This homework assignment was a good introduction to coding with Spark. I enjoyed this, because it was a nice balance of using SQL in the first few questions with PySpark (in my case). I did have trouble with understanding how to interact with the batch of .XML files and I wish I started earlier with that aspect. I was frustrated by the last problem a little bit, due to the fact that I wish we went over more of the ETL process and working with XML files and parsing. I felt a little overwhelmed with that section, but all things considered, it was a fair assignment.
