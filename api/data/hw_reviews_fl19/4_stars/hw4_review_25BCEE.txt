This assignment was much more enjoyable than the others. I had a lot of fun implementing map reduce and seeing the results of the map reduce. I think being able to implement what we learn in class directly was very helpful for learning. If I got to start again, I would make sure I check Piazza periodically when I'm stuck because I struggled for a long time why my files were not being found. After checking Piazza, I found that someone had the same issue with using '~' in the file path. Overall, the assignment was fun.
