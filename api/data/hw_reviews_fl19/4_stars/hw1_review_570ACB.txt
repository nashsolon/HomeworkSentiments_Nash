I liked this assignment a lot. I learned important things about data mining, machine learning, and how big data works to build models. Because I love solving Maths problems, I enjoyed solving the second question. That one is probably my favourite question. I did not like the last question, though. I feel like I learn most effectively by doing things. Learning by doing. The last question is more like describing stuff.
