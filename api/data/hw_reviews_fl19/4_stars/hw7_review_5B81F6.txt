What surprised me was that I did not know what to do when I reached TopNMapper since I thought I had to write sorting algorithm. But I saw in lab 6, professor shared a github link that solved a similar problem using topnlist. The person used sorted map to easily sort the data. After that I was able to proceed. Another problem that was difficult was the last one since I did not know how to connect the memory/communication cost we learned from the slides with our implementation. I do not know if I got it correct, but I can assure myself that I tried hard on that problem. If I could go back, I would definitely look at lab 6 slide to check the github link since I implemented aggregatemapper without the help and it increased my runtime significantly.
