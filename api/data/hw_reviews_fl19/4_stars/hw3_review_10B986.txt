I really like the part that we include lab problems into the homework which makes sure that everybody will complete the lab and think about the result got from lab problems. We actually learn from practice which help me understand the materials better. We also have some concept practice which is really good for exam preparation. If I could do this homework again, I would do lab2 again first before I do the homework.
