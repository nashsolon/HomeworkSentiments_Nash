The part in this homework I like is still the coding part, it really gives me the core idea of what's going on for the Mapper input and output, reducer input and output and what does cosine similarity means. The most important thin I learnt is how to use two methods, which are known as user-user similarity and item-item similarity, to analyze a same set of data. This surprises me because for the sane set of data there are different interpretations. Also I'm sure there are more than two methods for analyzing, so there are more interpretations, which is amazing. I would definitely go over some of the old definitions, like identity reducer, because some of these important definitions are starting to fade away from my memory, which is not helpful for understanding the homework.
