Generally speaking I like most parts of this assignment. In problem 1 we spent some time reading the textbook and had a deeper understanding about some designs and features of HDFS. Problem 2 and 3 also offers us good opportunities to practice map reduce and think about what the data should look like at each phase. If I could start over again, I would choose to spend more time reviewing the slides and textbooks before trying to answer any question as it might save me a lot time.
