I think this assignment is really good for my understand and practice, since these problems greatly strengthen my understanding for mapreduce process in real world as well as the data flow.

But I do consider problem 2&3 a little bit overlap with each other. I do think the coverage of the homework can be more various,instead of aiming at the class contents and theorical knowledge. Also, I find the contents of lab is a little bit hard and much more pratical so maybe adding lab contents to homework is also a good way!
