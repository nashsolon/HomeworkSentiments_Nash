a.	I like the problem 2 most. The skew problem. Actually before this question, I never think about this problem. I also didn’t find it in my book. But after this homework, I learned what is the skew and how to prevent it. So I like this part most. As for the other part, I don’t think they are quite meaningful as this one.
b.	I think the most important thing is be careful to all problems. I always find some spell problems or some other misunderstanding with question. So I make wrong answers many times. Although I will recheck my answer, But I feel it cost me a lot of time. In this assignment, the problem 2. I made some mistakes. I confused the relationship between  reduce task and skew.
