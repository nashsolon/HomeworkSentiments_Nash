This homework assignment is really interesting. The name "inverted index" itself is somehow not following our intuition. Therefore, understanding the first homework problem is quite a struggle. Once it was understood, then everything is on the right path. Doing all those normalized cosine similarity calculations is quite repetitive. So I think maybe later there could be less repetition in the same kind of problem.
