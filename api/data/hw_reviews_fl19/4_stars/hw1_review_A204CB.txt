During hw1 and lab1, when I try to copy shakesphere set from windows to vmware, vmware crashed and cannot be opened, so I re-installed them, but data lost. I am not sure if it will happens again. I missed the class on first week so have to run for task. I am not sure if I can finish it on time. I am not depressed, but really in anxiety because I have too much task and project to finish beyond courses.
