I like this homework since this time it is not as time-consuming as homework4 which is, in my opinion, nice for a weekly homework. It also contains some math work to help us understand the mechanism behind the recommendation system. The most important thing I learned is how to extract the filename as a value and output it. Also, the math behind the recommendation system —— the similarity measure is also important.
