I like this homework much better than ther prvious onces. Firstly, it has a larger proprotion of coding, which I think better help us digest the settings and alogrithms for the lecture covered this week. Secondly, the questions themselves are much clear and easy to understand than befor. Thanks for making the wording of the questions better. Then part I dislike is that in question we only need to edit one file.
