I really enjoyed this homework assignment. I really liked the spark part of the assignment where we were parsing out data. It was really cool to see how we were able to go from really poorly formatted data to the output that we finally got. I didn't really like the length of the assignment it just didn't allow me to fully go into depth of understanding that I would have liked. I really liked the real world application of this assignment.
