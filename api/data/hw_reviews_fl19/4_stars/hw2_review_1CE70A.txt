I like question 2 and 3 because they let me do the mapreduce process by hand, which certainly improve my understanding of the whole process.
I don't like question1(f) because when it asks me to describe how the data is located and transfered, I don't really know what it is asking for. Like is it about the code? Is it about the namenode? How detailed should I go in this explaination? I like questions that are more clear, that you certainly know which part of the knowledge it is testing you about.
I learned that there is probably hardly a "perfect" solution in real world. We are always deciding between several factors. In the case of HDFS, we have to consider the cost of different decisions so that we can make the one that is more suitable for current need.
