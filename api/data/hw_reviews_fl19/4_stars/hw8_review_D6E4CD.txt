This homework truly covers lots of topics, ranging from hive peocessing, spark concepts and spark input files processing. I was trapped in probelm 5 for lots of time since the unfamiliar use of spark context and command. Also, since the input is XML format, which is much more complex to see the output in the terminal. Also, I look forward to using spark in the industrial situation since running spark in termial is also somewhat strange and not conveinent enough.
