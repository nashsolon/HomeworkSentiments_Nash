I really like problem 1, where I got a chance to practice to determine the properties of big data. I found this concept very confusing when taking the lecture. But, after seeing concrete examples and made comparisons between those examples, I now clearly understand this concept. I also feel the concept in problem 2 is interesting. It always makes sense to me that randomness plays a role when dealing with big data. And specifically calculate the probability, I now have very solid reasoning. However, I believe that it could be better if we simply go through this idea or example in the class before this homework.
