I think the most important thing I learned from this assignment was how to properly implement ToolRunner and pass parameters to the driver from the command lien through ToolRunner. This is clearly a much more flexible way to run and test mapReduce programs, and actually coding it will definitely help me for the rest of the semester. I liked writing the partitioner and using the distributed cache, as it was very helpful for learning how these two components worked in detail.
