 I like the part that the homework is not very overwhelming, in fact only 3 questions. and i found the probability problem very interesting.

by answering the first question, i went through all the conceptual content of lecture 1 which i think is a good way to review.

I am surprised that I need to actually read a long article to answer question 3 

I enjoying doing calculation more than reading comprehension. I understand they are all important, but it is my personal opinion. If I were given the chance to do the hw1 again I think I would spend more time on reading .^ ^
