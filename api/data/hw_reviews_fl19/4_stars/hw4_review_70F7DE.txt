The homework 4 helped me in understanding the practical approach of the mapreduce program.The most important thing is that I have learnt how to apply multiple concepts to a single problem.We applied tool runner, distributed cache and paritioner in a single program which I felt was pretty difficult to solve.It took a lot of time in understanding why the errors were occuring and to debug them.The concept I liked the most is the tool runner which is really helpful in the real world situations as we can provide commandline arguments.On the whole I like the homework but felt it was a little difficult compared to all the assignments given so far.
