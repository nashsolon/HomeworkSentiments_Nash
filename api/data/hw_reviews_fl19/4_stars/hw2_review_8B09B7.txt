What I like about this assignment is that it helps me to go through all the concepts of cloud computing and the structure of HDFS cluster we learned in the class. The questions on influence of of the HDFS cluster based on the changes of replication factor and block size made me to do extra readings and think deeply about the structure and framework of the HDFS cluster. And I think this is a good way to remember the knowledge.
What I donâ€™t like about this assignment is that Problem 1(f) is not very clearly stated. Since we did not talk about very much on how data is transferred from HDFS to local client  in the courses, I can not give a certain answer about the mechanism of the download process of HDFS.
If I could start over again, I may just go through all the lecture slides and lab instructions first and then do the homework. Since all the questions are related to the topics talked in the class and labs, so it is a good way to first summarize the content of the lecture notes first so that we do not need to run around here and there for a specific topic.
