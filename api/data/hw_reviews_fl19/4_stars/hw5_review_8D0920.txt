What I did not like about this homework was all the dependencies needed to implement
a relatively small amount of code. I ran into several errors, even though the code was correct,
because the imports were off.

I did like walking thru the example of the similarity measures, and also the thought needed 
into going over which ones are useful and why.

What surprised me was how simple the code was to execute. If I could do things differently 
I would have looked more directly at the book beforehand.
