This homework was more enjoyable than some of the previous ones. It was pretty cool to get familiarized with database queries again. Working on some of the hive problems were fun and trying to figure out the correct query was like solving a puzzle so it was fun. The spark portion of the homework was somewhat more difficult since my python background isn't that strong, but it was mostly just figuring out which methods to use at what time, so a lot of googling and looking at documentations.
