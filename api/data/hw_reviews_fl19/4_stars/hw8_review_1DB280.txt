This is a very interesting homework for practicing writing spark program as well as using HIVE. It's truly friendly that we don't need to write java program in eclipse on a virtual machine anymore that's really horrible ... If I'll do it again then I'll after reading the chapters about that. P.s. I'm not sure that part that asking for the definition of pipelining. Cuz in my view it's a mechanism of MLlib which is clearly not in this case.
