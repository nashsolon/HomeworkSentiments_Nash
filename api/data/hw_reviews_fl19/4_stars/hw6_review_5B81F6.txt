One thing I liked about this assignment was that most of the homework consisted of writing codes. That was quite fun but for partitioner, it took me a long time to implement it. I was going to make a double array to store characters in each numReduceTask index but I figured that that would actually make it to run longer than it should be since it would need three for loops. Instead I divided up the range and incremented the return value by 1 if the first character of the word did not fit in the range. If I could start over again, I would actually start with question 2. This is because when I implemented a stringpairwritable in problem 1, it worked perfectly. However, when I just used the same code, problem 2 code did not work at all. So I had hard time figuring it out that we need to return -1 when a is less than b from the slide. So it took me about an hour just to figure that out.
