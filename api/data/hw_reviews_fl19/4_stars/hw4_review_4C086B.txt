I really appreciated this homework. Starting from a point where we understood what was happening (i.e. a MapReduce job that didn't implement ToolRunner) and updating it to the new form was very helpful. It gave me a better understanding of how Hadoop implements MapReduce both with and without the help of ToolRunner. I wish problems 1b and 1c were a little bit more clear about what they were looking for. If I could start over and do the assignment again, I would've started earlier and spent a little more time planning and learning about the execution process rather than jumping straight in to coding.
