I thought this homework was a great assignment for a few reasons. It made us better coders and also made us think about the concepts in a way that wasn't annoying. I know that this class is supposed to teach us systems, but I wish it were more of an applications class where we focused on learning how to code spark programs rather than understand how hadoop works in the background.
