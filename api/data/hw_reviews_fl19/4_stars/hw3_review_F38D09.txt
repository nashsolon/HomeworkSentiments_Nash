I like how this homework assignment gives us opportunity to go through the database and application again. I am more adept at using all those ternimal commands. However, I am not really a fan of reading through Wikipedia sources. But coming up with ideas of giving suggestions based on what I read is quite a lot of fun. If I can start over with this assignment, I will definitely go through the labs again before I can do the assignment without looking back to the instructions as described in labs.
