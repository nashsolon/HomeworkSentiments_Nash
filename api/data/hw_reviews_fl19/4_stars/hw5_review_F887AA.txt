This homework was definitely a little better than last one. Although, I spent a lot of time figureing out the coding part. I still am not perfectly sure what was the problem, but my mapreduce kept producing empty files. It only got fixed when I reverted back to one of earliest snapshots I saved, and did almost exactly same thing. It works now, so that was a relief. The rest of the problems were okay. I liked it that it involved some math, as math and calculations are always my strongest game. As much as I love the coding portions, math never betrays you. You will know right away if you're going wrong direction, so I definitely would love to have more questions like problem 2.
