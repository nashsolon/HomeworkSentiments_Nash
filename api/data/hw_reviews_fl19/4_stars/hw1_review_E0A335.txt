What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
The most interesting problem is 2, since it's a probability problem and consume less time than the other two problems. What I don't like is problem three which include too many chapters that are too overwhelming for people new to this area. I didn't mean that reading materials are not welcomed. This one just makes me feel too much.
What surprised you, and why?
The answer for problem 2 actually surprised me. It tells me to choose the thing I'm learning carefully, sometimes just purely random data might generate some pattern if you are not careful enough.
Assuming you could start over again(with working on the assignment),what would you do differently and why?
For problem 3, I would go through the entire article at once and then answer the problem. What I actually do is try to find the answers by scan through each paragrapgh. Which is not working for this one. Took me longer than just read through it.
