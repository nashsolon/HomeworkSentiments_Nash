Found this hw harder than usual. I like when there is a flag to capture like in 1a where we show a specific output. I didn't like 3b because I believe it could be done in a few different ways. I was surprised by doing things that are actually useful. If I could do it over again, I would love more direction to where in the slides or book certain subjects are that can help us on certain problems.
