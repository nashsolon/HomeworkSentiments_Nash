I really enjoyed this assignment. I really enjoyed learning about Bonferroni's principle as I enjoyed the applied mathematics to seeing how you can identify evil-doers. It also allowed me to exercise my knowledge of probability which I found extremely valuable. The one thing I disliked about this homework was part 3. I did not like part three because I found the article confusing and the questions didn't make a lot of sense to me. Next time, I will try to spend more time understanding the article. I was surpised by the application of Bonferroni's principle to capturing terrorists. I think it was this that showed me how applicable the information in this class is to the real-world.
