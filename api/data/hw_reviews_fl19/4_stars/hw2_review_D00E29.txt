This assignment was intriguing but different from the first assignment. I definitely appreciated the fact that the assignment was a balance of being difficult, yet intriguing. It also helped to reinforce the lessons learned in class and lab in a practical and logical way. I wish that this assignment had another question relating to some set of reading assignment. However, it was still an important assignment and I learned quite a bit from it. I think the most significant learning aspect of the assignment was the practical application of MapReduce and working through the logic of the program. I think the assignment was great, but I struggled at first determining how exactly to set up the MapReduce program, but it worked out in the end.
