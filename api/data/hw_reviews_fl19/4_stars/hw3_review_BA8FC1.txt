I like most part of this homework. The only thing I would like to comment on is about the terminology. Even though the handout somehow clarifies this inconsistency, I still believe we may address this problem earlier, like the first time we have learned these terms. Or we could write some notices on the slide when we first talk about them so that I could be more aware of these concepts.
I like the idea of skew. I kind of had a similar question during the class and did not get a chance to ask. Now I know how we address this problem. The idea of using a combiner is pretty cool.
