Homework 5 was significantly better than homework 4. Like the previous homework assignments, I enjoyed the fact that we were able to work on the concepts from lecture that were reinforced in problems 2 and 3. I think the best thing I learned was the proof and intuitively seeing the relationship between the normalized version of the cosine similarity and how the Pearson similarity was equivalent to that. I think I did well doing problems 2 and 3 first, but I would have started the coding earlier and taken advantage of all the TA hours.
