This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of hive table and spark. I do learn more about the general procedure of hive table and how to play around with spark shell, etc. I don't really like the question 5, although it basically just asks about implementation practices, it would be better if we get more advices and hint. It is frustrating to be trapped by small and minor bugs that is also hard to search on google because it is just too basic.
