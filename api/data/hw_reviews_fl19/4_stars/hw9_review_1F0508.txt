I thought this homework was rather straightforward and easy for the most part. The tasks served well to give good practice of handling data in spark. However, we spent a good amount of time trying to figure out why our 2e was getting stuck on join, a note should have been added on the hw to let us know what to do in that case.

I think the most important lesson was that running jobs locally on a single thread can give rise to memory issues.
