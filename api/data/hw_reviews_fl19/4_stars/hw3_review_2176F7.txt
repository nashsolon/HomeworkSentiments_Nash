I like this assignment hw3, because it leads me to carefully read through textbooks and understand some really important concepts. The most important thing I learned is the use of YARN. Because it is a useful tool to manage job execution in MapReduce Task and there is a specific anatomy for the application of YARN which can help us understand the working principle of Hadoop better.
