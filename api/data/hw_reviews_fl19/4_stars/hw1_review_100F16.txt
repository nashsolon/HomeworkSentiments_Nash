What I liked about this assignment is that I got to think more about different type of big data and their possible underlying physical implementations. A surprising thing I learned is that according to the Bonferroniâ€™s Principle, the result we mine from big data could be due to randomness instead of real patterns. Something I did not like is that the questions for the article are a little bit unclear.
