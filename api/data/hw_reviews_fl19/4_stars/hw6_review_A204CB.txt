I feel crazy about matching the types. The code and logic is not hard, but it jumps out error frequently about types mismatch, intwritable, long, text, string. And they cannot be directly coverted. Another problem annoying is the debug. I do not know how to watch the process and print parameter value, so I have to guess. And why do we always need to complie it to a jar file and run and open results. I prefer eclipse output, but it keeps output something that less update. I do not know why.
