For this homework, I am extremely confused about the difference between cosine distance and cosine similarity. It seems like they indicate the dissimilarity and similarity of the data set respectively. But when I read the book, there exists some differences between the books and lecture slides. These differences make me confused aboutthis concept. Besides, I really like the first problem because it makes me learn and practice how to implement the inverted index in mapreduce. It's really really interesting. I like it! I hope we can have more such practices in further study. Meanwhile, I hope we have relatively rich time to implement these. Maybe we can have a extension part which can be posted at the begining of the semester, and students can finish them if they have time.
