During this homework, I liked how we had to define our own StringPairWritable. At first, completing the three methods was confusing. However, when I was able to make it work, I fully understood how other writable objects work. I also enjoyed the problem 3 in which I had to compute the cosine similarity between all pairs of movies.  Through this problem, I was able to understand how each output and input of Job 1 and 2 is formatted and review the calculation of cosine similarity.
