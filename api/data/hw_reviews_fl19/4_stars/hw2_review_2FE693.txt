I found this homework much more informative than the last one. Definitely feel like I'm learning stuff. Found 1d to be a little difficult; I'm not an artist haha. Learned about nodes, blocks, racks, etc. I would drop another class so I'd have more time. Starting the semester off with some stress. Hoping it balances out.
