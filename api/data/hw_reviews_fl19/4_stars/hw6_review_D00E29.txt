Homework 6 was interesting. I think the last problem, while tedious was a good exercise with the fundamentals of how MapReduce works in the context of collaborative filtering. It was also good to combine that with using a measure such as cosine similarity to work through the problems. While coding is key, I think perhaps this assignment should have been due the Thursday after Fall break, have homework 7 assigned with 2 weeks, and for this assignment to have a few more problems like question 3 with the other algorithms we went over in class. Regardless, it is good practice for the eventual midterm. My biggest regret with this assignment had little to do with the assignment and my upgrade to Catalina. It took up most of the week to fix and I couldn't fix some issues to complete the coding section. I wish I waited to download the update.
