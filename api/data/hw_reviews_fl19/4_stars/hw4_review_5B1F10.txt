I liked the coding components of this assignment. Both implementing ToolRunner and writing a Partitioner effectively supplemented my classroom learning by requiring me to develop a more robust and practical understanding of the two concepts. The most important thing I learned from this assignment was the reasons for implementing ToolRunner and the value of using a Partitioner to categorize and divide output. However, as has been a common trend with assignments, the written response questions were written extremely poorly and were consequently unnecessarily difficult to understand. For example, questions 1b and 1c were extremely vague, and I disliked the fact that they did not make sense, and Piazza answers were further unhelpful in understanding the questions. I hope to receive more clear and direct questions in future homework assignments.
