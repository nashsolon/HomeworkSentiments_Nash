To be honest half of me like this homework and half of me dislike this homework. As usual, the reason I like this homework is it summarize what we have cover from last two weeks, and it refines my coding skill as well, I learned a lot of useful skills such as lambda function. Now, the reason I dislike this is mainly the lack of guidance for coding, I have to search a lot of on google for the function I have to use. Most important thing I learned is lambda anonymous function, it's so important that I think most of the rest material replies on this. One thing that surprises me is how flexible I can extract information from Hive. If I could start again, I want to go office hours instead of searching the function over the internet again and again to avoid wasting time.
