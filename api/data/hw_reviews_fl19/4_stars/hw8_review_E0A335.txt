This homework is harder than the previous one, probabily because we are using a lot of new stuffs such as hive and spark. the time I spend on problem 5 is longer than I expected and I have to go through all the slides again and again to find the properate function and action that needs to be applied.
I don't like to use spark since sometimes even when the statements go through, there are still a lot of excpetion messeage coming up, I don't know if that is my own computer's issue. I have to go to hdfs to check weather the execution is valid or not, also the exception is really hard for me to understand. so it took me longer to debug.
