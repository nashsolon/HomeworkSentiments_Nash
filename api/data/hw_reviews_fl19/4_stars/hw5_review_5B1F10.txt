I liked the opportunity to code in this assignment. I felt that writing the inverted_index MapReduce() program was helpful to my understanding of how to craft a full MapReducer() program, including the Mapper, Reducer, and Driver classes. I was surprised by how math-heavy this assignment was (particularly Problem 2 and Problem 3), but I appreciated the opportunity to apply the various similarity measures in order to better understand their advantages and disadvantages in addition to how to actually calculate them. I believe the most important thing I learned was that the normalized cosine similarity measure and the Pearson correlation measure are actually the same, and the exercise of proving so was fulfilling.
