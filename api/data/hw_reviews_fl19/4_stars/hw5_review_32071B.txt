Hw5 contains two part. The first part is about coding, which I like. The second part is about Similarity Measures (Problem 2 and Problem 3). For the problem 2, I find out that our slides and the book have different definition of cosine similarity, because they treat unrated data different (slides treat them as blank, book treats them as 0). I feel like this inconsistency should be mention in our class, and also talk about their pros and cons. For the problem 3, I feel it worth 30 points. Because I don't have much to talk about it. Also, I feel problem 2(e) and problem 3(b) 3(c) should be treat as one problem. Because they are talking about pros and cons of using different similarity.
