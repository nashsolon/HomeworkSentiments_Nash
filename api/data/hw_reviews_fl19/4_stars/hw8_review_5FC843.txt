Overall I liked this homework significantly better than previous assignments because the emphasis was on coding. I did not like problem 4 because I could not find that many resources in the slides or in the textbook that helped me solve this problem. I think if it s a hw problem it should be more thoroughly discussed in class. I also did not like that confusing wording of the hive queries for problem 3 since I feel the directions should have been more clear.
