I liked the assingment, but the first question required reading that wasn't too helpful for certain questions. Some questions the text reading didn't elaborate on, but some readings targeted the questions very directly. I liked reading the textbook to understand the concepts more concepually. I really liked drawing the HDFS diagram, that helped me visualize the system a lot better. The most important thing I learned was how MapReduce works and it's important because it shows how the software actually works behind the scenes. I wasn't surprised by anything. If I could redo the assignment, I would give myself more time to read over the textbook.
