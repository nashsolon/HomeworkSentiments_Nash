One thing I like abouht this assignment is that it involves a lot of code experience like command line. It's unlike the last assignment which are reading and analyzing. It gives a hand-on experience about how to manage dfs file by hadoop command. The most important thing I learned is how dfs organizes file. I heard about this in class but I was a little confused. In homework, we're required to draw the framework of dfs and it gives me a lot insight.
