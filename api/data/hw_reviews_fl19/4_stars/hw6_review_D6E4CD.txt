For the problem two, it is closely connected with the lab5. Since there are different outcomes after each step. It takes me long time to figure out the parameters setup and understand the meaning for each comparator, which strengthen my understanding to the theroy of secondary sorting. For the problem3, firstly I considered the whole is a single job and get the wrong outcome. I finally get the cosine similarity with two jobs, with job one grouping the movie by their rating and the other calcualting the cosine similarity.
