This homework was quite challenging for some parts. We were confused about how many weblog data we should have. Some people had 311 while others had 312. The difference in number of data also changes our number for counts on html and jpg. We also had a difficult time understanding how to do the diagram for problem 2. We had a hard time finding documention for examples on how it should be done. The TAs were very helpful for this problem. Overall, I feel like this assignment was a bit more difficult.
