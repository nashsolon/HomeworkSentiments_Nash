What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?

I like the assignment when it appears math induction like Problem2. I like math so it’s my strength to show my work in the form of math. And I don’t like reading. The paper (in problem 3) is too long to read and the analyze is hard for me.

What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so ?  
The most important thing I learned is “Bonferroni’s Principle” since it clearly describe how the “bogus” appears and how to avoid it as the data size keeps growing.
