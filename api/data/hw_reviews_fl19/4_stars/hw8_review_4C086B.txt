I like the variety in this homework assignment. Having enough of both Hive and Spark to get a solid introduction while not overloading the amount of information was very useful. I wish there was a little bit more about the usefulness of the pipelining in Spark though. A little refresher of SQL was good for me as well. If I could start this assignment over again, I definitely would've started earlier.
