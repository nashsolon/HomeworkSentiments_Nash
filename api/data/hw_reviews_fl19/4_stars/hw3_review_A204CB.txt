Nervous all the day. Since another course have project and quiz on the same day this homework is due, and the code in wordCount does not work well. Missed the meeting in the morning. Long time not meet with professor. Have tasked unfinished. Papers have not finished. Collabortor keep focusing on some not import thing such like the way plot figures. Another project does not have progress. Worked on the quiz for a long time and the result like trash. The homework of this course keeps asking for describes. So on.
