This homework was intriguing and great. I think it was good familiarizing ourselves more with Spark, and I appreciate the chance we got to really run scripts and learn more about that process, especially since those are the types of things that would be useful for us with the final project and in general. The one thing I wish we had more of was the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in class. I was confused at first as to what was wanted from question 2f and I wasn't certain of the formatting etc. It ended up working out fine, but if we had more time, that would have been great. I also wish I started reading the slides earlier so as to have an easier time finishing the homework.
