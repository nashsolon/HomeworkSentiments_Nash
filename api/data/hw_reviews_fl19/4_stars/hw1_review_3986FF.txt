I would say I really enjoy the part where I reviewed the theoretical knowledge from class, especially part A of the homework; with these knowledge, it would be easier for me to work on the next problems or future ones. I would say the part involving calculations was harder for me, as it took me some time to figure out how to do all the math. The most important thing I learned is to pay attention to the details involved in the course, such as what aspects might be involved in data mining. I was surprised by the fact data mining isn't a panacea, and problems may arise if we abuse it. If I could start over again, I would probably read the book more carefully and memorize important details.
