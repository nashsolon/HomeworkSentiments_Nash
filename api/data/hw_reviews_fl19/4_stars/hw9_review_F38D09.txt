This homework assignment covers a lot of stuff that we have learnt about pyspark. I really like how this one is formatted, with one problem following lab for step by step instructions, and another problem which that we have to actually implement the whole program ourselves. This laid a good foundation for the final project which I will be doing for pyspark. However, I am not certain how to draw the DAG graph. That takes me a while. I hope that there are some examples that can be covered in class.
