I found this homework very helpful. I really like the fact that we are going very in-depth as to how Hadoop actually works/operates, and I feel like this assignment has given me a great understanding of how a MapReduce application runs on Hadoop. If I could do anything differently on this homework, I would have started earlier. The most important thing I learned is how different numbers of reduce tasks might affect overall efficiency of a MapReduce application.
