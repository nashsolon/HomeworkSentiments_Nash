Regarding this assignment, I really liked question 2. This was a challenging problem that required quite an amount of thinking to solve (even using the textbook example as a guide). It also helped us see how the sheer amount of data can lead to "false accusations." I did not like question 1e), I don't think listing data types really helped me learn anything new, and in general it seemed a little weird to describe some data types (like the links in the wiki pages).

What surprised me most in this assignment was part of the conclusion from question 2. as our parameters become more specific (3 people visited same hotel 3 separate days, compared to 2 people visited same hotel 2 separate days), the chances of false accusations became lower by incredibly large magnitudes. 

Assuming I could start this assignment over, I think I should have reread the powerpoint slides before I answered the first questions. Those questions were a great way to reiterate what we learned in class, as the format was almost exactly as we covered it, I had to rewrite some of my answers after I relooked at the slides.
