Reflection for hw1:

I personally think that the assignment was good but it was lengthy and required a lot of effort.One thing i liked about the assignment is that it provided insights into the charecteristics of data and applications of big data into various fields. I struggled to derive the formula for the second problem and needed to invest a lot of time to solve it.Over all it was nice and interesting working for the assignment.
