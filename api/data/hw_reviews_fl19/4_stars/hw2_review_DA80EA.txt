I really enjoyed the mapreduce portion of the assignment. I found this process to be extremely intuitive for me and I found that it made a lot of logical sense to me. I did not like the high level questions about HDFS as I found them a bit confusing. Specifically I struggled to figure out the disadvantages of HDFS, The most important thing that I learned was how the mapreduce process works and why it is so important. I also found the information on why the size of the replication factor is not super large extremely valuable. I also liked learning about metadata and why its size is also important in terms of seeking out data.
