I enjoyed doing the hands-on examples of computing the various similarity metrics and analyzing which one worked best for different cases. I also learned a lot from writing the mapreduce program to take in input file names, as this could have lots of applications for future mapreduce jobs. One thing that surprised me was the ability to use the similarity metrics on datasets that had many incomplete rows, and how to normalize differences amongst individuals in the Pearson metric. If I could start over, I would definitely read through the mapreduce program and determine the mapper input/output and the reducer input/output before starting to write the mapreduce program.
