This homework was a little bit confusing since it was a bit hard wrapping my logic around all of the intermediate steps in between each mapper and reducer since we have so many now. I didn't like how there were certain parts of the code that wasn't really a part of the pre-requisites to this class and I didn't know how to do, but I had to do a lot of googling to figure out what it meant like serialization in Java. The homework was goo practice though. I was able to see more of what was going on between each step along the way from doing this homework.
