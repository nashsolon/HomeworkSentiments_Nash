I struggled a lot with problem one and I wish there could have been better support regarding importing the data. My main trouble came from my minimal understanding of the difference between wholeTextFiles and textFile. If I were to do this homework again, I would have done a better job of gaining clarification from TA's or the instructor before beginning. I liked problem two, however. I believed it was well documented in slide and provided a nice step-by-step problem set leading up to the end result. I was suprise by problem 2F and wished we had done a small example in class potentially in the lab because I felt it was pretty glanced over.
