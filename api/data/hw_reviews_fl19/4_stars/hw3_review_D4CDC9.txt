This homework was somewhat better than previous ones. I found that the questions provided a reasonable challenge and that they helped me deepen my understanding of the material and understand the gaps in my knowledge. Something that I've found somewhat frustrating is that page numbers for books are frequently given, but since all the textbooks are online, there is no way to actually go to a page, so I largely have to guess as to where to go in the textbook. In general, I wish that the slides were much clearer, as the book tends to get into far too much detail. I was surprised by how little coding there was and wish that we were forced to do more coding, as hands-on experience is what actually helps drive the material into memory.
