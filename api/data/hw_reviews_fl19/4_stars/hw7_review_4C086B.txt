I found this homework to be very interesting. I liked the ability to write a MapReduce program from scratch, especially since this one was more complicated. I also liked that there was a decent amount of information that we needed to find out ourselves (such as how to actually run a second job on the output of a first). If I could start over again, I definitely would've started earlier.
