I like this assignment because it made me to code the Mapreduce from scratch.And I used YARN Resource Manager to oberserve the job execution status. And counting the word co-occurance is a good application of simple text mining. What I dislike the assignment is that the relevant questions are less than usual homework. If I could do this assignment again, I could code and test the program incrementally to aviod bugs that are difficult to find.
