I liked that the assignment included applications of MapReduce so that I can practice this on my own and fully understand it outside of the classroom. I disliked all of the questions about HDFS, but I understand why it is useful to know. The most important thing I learned is the commands for HDFS and how blocks work in HDFS along with tradeoffs of using HDFS. I was surpised that HDFS does not work well with low latency systems. If I did this assignment again I would've done all of the required reading first, instead of reading alongside the assignment.
