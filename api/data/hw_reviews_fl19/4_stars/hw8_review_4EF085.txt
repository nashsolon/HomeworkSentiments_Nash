This homework was a great practice for using hive commands to form and query tables. Although I like to have coding problems in the homework, this homework was still enjoyable and helpful. What I did not like in this homework was the problem 3. I think the instructions for problem 3 part d and e were a little vague. Especially, in the problem 3 part d, it was not obvious to use the products table. Questions about Part e was resolved once I figured out about the product's brand and name.
