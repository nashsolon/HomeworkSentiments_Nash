Homework 7 was interesting, and definitely a lot more coding that usual. I definitely appreciated the assistance Professor Neumann provided via the GitHub link. It was a good balance between having a baseline structure for the assignment and needing to modify and change certain things around. The coding problems were definitely reasonable and able to be implemented. The only drawback of this assignment was how unclear it was when relating to the communication cost. It was very confusing as to what exactly we were trying to do with that part of problem 3. I wish we talked more about it in class, because it definitely is an involved concept. I think I struggled with little mistakes, so giving myself a little more time would have been ideal.
