I liked that we used netflix data. It makes the class feel applicable. I also just like ratings analysis for the same reason. Most important thing was how to write teh code. I am surprised that we have to write this much code for every assignment. I wish things were easy to apply to all. If I could start over, I would have finished the lab earlier.
