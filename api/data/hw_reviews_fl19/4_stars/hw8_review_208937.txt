I really like this assignment, basically because this homework contains the problems related to hive, which is a new concept I learned and also spark, so in this assignment, I practiced how to use hive and spark, I did not feel I have started to learn these two concepts until I completed all assignment problems.
The most important thing I learned from this assignment is that pay attention to details when reading the assignment. When I was doing the very last problem in this assignment, I did not pay attention to where to create the folder loudacre, it should be created in the the root directory, however, at first, I just simply think I can create a folder like I did before, which is not in the root directory, when I completed all questions, I suddenly realize I made the folder wrong place and hence have to start over again from the first question, and one more thing I learned is when I deleted the wrong folder, I delete the data which will be used in the next assignment by mistake and then I have to run the lab 8 again to restore the data, which is annoying. Hence, I learned that never be too rush, otherwise I have to spend more time fixing the mistakes.
