It takes me much time to load correct data to the hadoop/loudacre/weblogs. Even though the file count is correct, it stills exists some errors due to the incorrect try. Also, the problem2 is like a toy example for us to practice writing spark action and transformation. When it comes to problem 3 and problem 4 which covers the contents of spark job execuation and Pagerank, I review the lecture and complete the python file. At first, I thought it is scala only question but fail to implement the mvn file.
