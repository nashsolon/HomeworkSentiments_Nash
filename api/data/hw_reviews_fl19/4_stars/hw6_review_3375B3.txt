I enjoyed this homework assignment and I believe it provided a nice balance between content we discussed in lecture as well as lab. Plus, there was little I got confused by. I appreciated that problem 2 was a continuation of the Secondary Sort lab and used the same commands as well as code we had worked on. It was nice to have the core background knowledge of the process before working with it in the homework. I did however get a little confused by question d) of problem 2 as a result I didnâ€™t really like it as much. 

The most important thing I learned this homework was gaining a much more solidified understanding of job modifiers and how to use them through problem two of this homework. 

If I were to do this homework again I would have made sure to finish the last remaining part of the secondary sort lab since it would have prepared me a bit better.
