This homework assignment is quite painful because using the virtual machine, the tool runner, and the hadoop is so much pain!!! It was supposed to be not hard with the coding part, and it turned out to be true. However, setting up the visual machine and using the eclipse and command line for tool runner, and running in hadoop or running locally, all of which was a mess!! It takes too much time to figure all these things out!!!! I don't like it!
