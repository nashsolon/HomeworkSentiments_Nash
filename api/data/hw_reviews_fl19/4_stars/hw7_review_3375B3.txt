I liked the challenge of being asked to build a whole mapReduce program from scratch for problem 1. I belive it really helped in bringing alot of the previous understanding together. I do, however, wish there was more direction in the form of slides. There was a lot of points where I struggled or was confused. I also wish that the memory difference between stripes and pairs was discussed more in lecture
