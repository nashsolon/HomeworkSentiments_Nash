This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of secondary sort and dual collaborative filtering. I do learn more about secondary sort and why do we nned different comparators and how to achieve global sort, etc. I also like the question that ask for a hands on experience with collaborative filtering. That definitel makes me thoroughly understand how that works.
