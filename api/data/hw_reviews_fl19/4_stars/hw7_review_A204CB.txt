The homework is always not easy, the more code, the harder. At least for me. The most time costing part is matching the type of input and output. It took me a long time to find which part (the text type) do not work and how to fix that (the long writable part). Fortunately, the second part, based on the example, most part is finished and I need only a little change on them. One of my concern is that, I found the time for finishing the lab is not enough for me. So does the homework. And the hour for TA is usually not enough. Sometimes two people before you will cost all the time.
