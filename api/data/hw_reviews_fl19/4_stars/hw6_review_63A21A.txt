I like the assignment because the custom WritableComparable helps me understand the implementation of Custom Writable interface in MapReduce and review the Inputformat. And the secondary sort problem plays with partitioner,global sort...I think it's a good idea to combine the content of lab with homework to give us a chance to get deep into the concept.And the item-item similarities computation helps me to generate the algorithm based on user-user similarities. If I could do this assignment again, I would remember to specify the input format in driver because I got a type mismatch exception in Mapper when testing the program and spend a while to figure it out.
