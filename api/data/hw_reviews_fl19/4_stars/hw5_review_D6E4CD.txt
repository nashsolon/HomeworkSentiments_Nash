For the problem one, the time for running to get output file is much longer than I expected. Instead of spending time on debugging and compiling, it took me much time to get the output file.
Problem2&3 deepens my understanding for the Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity,and collaborative filtering to learn more about the advantages and disadvantages to measure similarity. Sometimes, the meaning of problems confuses me. For example, I don't know 'repeat part(a)' in problem two means treating the utility as boolean or computing the similarity between each pair of users again.
