Being honest, this one was much better than the last one, in that all instructions given are much clearer after tweaked. Even though some confusions may occur, discussing with partner would help. Moreover, this hw is pretty much an intro to Hive and Spark, which reduces its difficulty. If I can start over again, I would probably choose to start later than the second version of instructions, which are definitely less confusing than the first one.
