The homework 3 helped me in getting a clear understanding of the concepts of mapreduce and the various functions associated within. The concept I liked the most is maintaining the efficiency of mapreduce by handling the data skew using combiners and also data locality optimization.The most importtant thing I learnt is that when dealing with huge amounts of data, it needs to be handeled carefully and lot of parameters such as processing time and efficiency have to be taken into consideration.Overall, it was a great homework to work.
