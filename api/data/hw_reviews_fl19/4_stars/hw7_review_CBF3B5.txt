This homework helped me understand the co-occurences. I liked how there was sample input given that we could test the code on. I found the instructions pretty straight forward and thought the implementations were pretty straightforward. Since weâ€™ve been talking more about hive and spark in lecture and lab, I kind of wished this homework was on that material, but overall thought it was a good homework.
