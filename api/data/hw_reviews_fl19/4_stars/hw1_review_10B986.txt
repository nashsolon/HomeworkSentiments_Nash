Generally, I like this assignment that each problem in it serves a different purpose. The problem 1 is a reflection of what we learned from class; the problem 2 is an interesting probability question that tells the infeasibility of monitoring evildoers; problem 3 is an extra reading to learn about NLP approaches. However, there is also something I don't like. The description in problem 2 and problem 3(b) are a little vague. To be specific, "the expected number of sets of p people that will be suspected of evil-doing" is not easy to understand (I think it is better to say "How many different combinations of p people that stay at the same hotel on d different days£¿") and "What does the model look like" makes me feel undirected. 

If I could start the homework over again, I would find a partner to work with me. I think the discusstion about question 2 and 3 between us would promote our understanding of the material, and I think the paper in question 3 is great and I would like to talk about it with another person.
