Overall the homework questions were pretty straightforward. The first question was especially helpful as it offered a chance to go through different types of examples to throughly understand the properties of data. I believe the key point of the first week of class was to clearly understand the definition and characteristics of data, therefore felt right to have started with this question and spent the most time on it.
As for the Bonferroni's Principle problem, it was more intriguing to see the actual mathwork done. While the reading problem was informative as well, I just find figuring out math more fun always.
