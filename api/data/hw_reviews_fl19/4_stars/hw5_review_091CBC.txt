I think this homework was more enjoyable than the last one. Some of the questions were a bit ambiguous but overall, it was a doable homework. The second part that asked for computing similarity was tedious and writing up the math/equations took longer than it should have. The reflections of seeing the similarities side by side was interesting though. Overall, it wasn't a bad homework.
