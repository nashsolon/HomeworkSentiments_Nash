I liked the exposure this assignment gave to big data. For me it was really nice
to see the lectures, reading and homework all relate and tie together. The only
thing I dislike about the assignment was the reading for the second problem did
not give a super clear explanation of the Bonferroniâ€™s Principle. It did a good
job of introducing it, I would have like to have seen one more example with it,
or another reading or different perspective on it. Other than that I enjoyed the
assignment and I thought it did a nice job of furthering my understanding of big
data. One thing that surprised me was how much data is out there and how much
data is continuing to be produced. If I could start this assignment over I think
I would have like to start the problem corresponding to each reading immediately
after, instead of waiting to start the homework after completing all the
reading.
