I like this hw much more comparing with the previous homeworks. First of all, due to fall break, I have two weeks to complete this homework so that I don't have to rush to finish it. Secondly, this is the first time I write the driver, mapper and reducer from scratch. Previously, Professor will provide some structures for coding. This time I literally wrote  it by myself. During this period, I make a small mistake. However, the command line just shows an empty result file without any error message. Hence, it took me a long time to discover where the problem is. If I don't have to write the mapper from scratch, I would never have the chance to make this mistake. 
The most important thing I learned from this homework is to be careful to every detail when coding. When I wrote the second job driver, to avoid from scratch, I just copied the first job driver and made some modifications. However, I forgot to change the job name from job1 to job2. As a result, it gave me a workable result file, however, without any result. I tried to find out where the mistake is, it did not give me any error message because job1 itself is correct. Finally, I spent a very long time to detect it. Hence. From this experience, I learned to pay attention to evert detail when coding.
