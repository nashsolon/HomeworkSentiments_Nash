What I like about this assignment is that all of the problems help me to review all the materials of job execution of MapReduce using YARN. In the lecture, we did not make it to go through all of the slides, so doing this homework is a good way to have a thorough understanding of the process of resource management.
The most important thing I’ve learned is that I finally figure out all of the notations such like Map task, mapper, map() function etc. The notations are easily confused and the notations varies across different materials so sometimes I can’t get the point at the lectures. Thanks to the homework and the table in Problem 2, I finally know why there are different expressions for the same terms.
