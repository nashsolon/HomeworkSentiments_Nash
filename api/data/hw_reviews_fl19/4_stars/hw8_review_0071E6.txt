 For this homework, I think the first four are relatively basic(but also important). These problems let me be familar with hive operations. And due to this homework I am interested in the rating and comment analysis. Althought I know I just know superfical knowledge about them. But I think I can do more and might div deeper in this field. And the most difficult part for me is the spark part. To be honst, I learn slowly about spark since there are a lot of new knowlege which need me to learn and digest. But I beleieve that I will be the "friend" of spark! Also, during this homework, I have some confusion, why should we use spark? what is its advantages and disadvantages? And some of my confusion have be resolved after completing this homework. And I think that the further study will help me to resolve all the confusion that I have.
