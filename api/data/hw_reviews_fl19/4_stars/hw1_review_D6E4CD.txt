enerally speaking, I think this assignment is good for me, since problem1 greatly strengthens my understanding for big data as well as the examples listed in the class, and other problems are challenging and interesting. But what surprised most is the coverage of the homework, ranging from class contents, reading the essay and probability problem. Also, the time spent on the this homework much more than the time I expected, especially on the probelm2&3.
