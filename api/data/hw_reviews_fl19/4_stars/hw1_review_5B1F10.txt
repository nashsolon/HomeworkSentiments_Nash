I liked that HW1 tested broad knowledge of course materials, from the lectures (problem 1) to the readings (problem 3) to math principles from the text (problem 2). However, I thought that the questions asked in Problem 3 were too vague and difficult to answer as they did not match up well to the terminology and concepts described by the authors of the article. Clearer questions that point to particular points in the article and are more specific about what answer they want would be preferable. I was surprised by the work it took to complete the Bonferroni's Principle question (problem 2) as my partner and I initially struggled to determine the correct formula. Nonetheless, I thought the question was interesting and the exercise of deriving the formula for the general case was beneficial. If I could start the assignment over again, I would have started working on it earlier and been more careful in the derivation of the formula for problem 2 so as to avoid having to troubleshoot and re-derive the formula and to better manage my time
