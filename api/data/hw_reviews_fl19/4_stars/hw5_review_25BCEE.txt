The mapreduce implementation of this project was really fun and was interesting to see the results. The portion that I disliked was having to crunch all the numbers because it was hard to compute without making mistakes. A lot of times, I felt unsure about my answers to many questions. If I had to restart the assignment, I would have started a little earlier and got a better idea of what each of the different measurements of similarity were before trying to simply crunch numbers. Overall, the length and difficulty of the assignment was well suited.
