What I liked about this assignment is that I have a chance to go through definitions and examples in the book carefully instead of skimming through it. Also, I had a chance to read an academic paper, so I know what is actually going on with respect to what we are studying. One thing I learned after finishing this assignment is that I know more about characteristics of big data through real life examples. So my understanding of big data is no longer at a shallow level.
