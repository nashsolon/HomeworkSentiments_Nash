I think this time, questions have been improved. Now they are all clearer and we can easily understand what questions are asking for. Those questions do help me interpret the concept more, especially question2, I do know more about skew after doing that. Moreovre, those "describe" questions, although boring, do help people review the concepts and know more about that.
