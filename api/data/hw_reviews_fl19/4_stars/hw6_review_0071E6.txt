For this homework, I like the second and the third question. The second question make me learn more about partial sort, global sort and secondary sort. We can define the partitioner by ourself and in this way even if we use more than 1 reducer we can achieve globally sorted. It's obviously we can achieve global sorting by just using one reducer. But in this situation, there are so much work on a single machine. Hence, using just one reducer is a bad idea!  For the third quesiton. it lets me recall the user-based collaborative filtering system. Compared with the user-based CF system, item-based collaborative system will be more efficient when the number of users is much more than the number of items. Besides, it's more easier to classify the similar items since we can readily catch items' features and genres. Also, users profiles might be changed quickly, but items'features or genres changed slowly. Based on these statement. Item-based collaborative system is better than user-based CF system.
And when find the oldest person with the same last name, I get confused at first glance. After re-read the function of each part, this problem get fixed!
