• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
  
I like Problem 1 because I can practice what I learned from class and it makes me have     more comprehension on the characteristic of big data.
 
• What surprised you, and why?

The problem 2. Because I think it's a good way for us to learn the power of big data by calculating by ourselves. I like this form because our textbook just give this example and tell us the result.
