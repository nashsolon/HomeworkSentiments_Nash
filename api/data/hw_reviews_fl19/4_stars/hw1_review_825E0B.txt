• What did you like about the assignment and why?
I like the problem 1 because each question has no exact answer and during doing the homework, we can have a talk about this part, which can help us have a better understanding of the materials.

• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
The problem 2 need to be figured out by probability and statistic. I don’t take such mathematic classes. This question can help me learn more about this part.
