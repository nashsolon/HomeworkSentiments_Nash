I liked that the assignment forced me to learn more about the details of how Hadoop handles job execution with YARN, something I found extremely confusing in class. However, at times I felt like the instructions were unclear and I was unsure of what exactly would merit full credit. It seems like graders are looking for certain keywords, with the lack of those keywords resulting in a loss of credit even if I explained everything correctly on a conceptual basis. I think the most important thing I learned from this homework was the use of a combiner, which seems like an absolutely critical way to improve runtime with certain MapReduce operations.
