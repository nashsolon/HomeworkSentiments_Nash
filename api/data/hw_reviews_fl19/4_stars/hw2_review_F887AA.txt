I really liked that we got to work with actual examples more than the last homework rather than discussing concepts only. It helps me understand the material far better. Problem 2 and 3 were fun to work with in that sense. I think it was important that we completely understand how the MapReduce works, and those problems made sure that I know exactly what the inputs and outputs would be in performing MapReduce. 
Some parts of problem 1, however, were a little bit of a struggle. I see Hadoop as a tool, and like any other tools, it has its purpose and it's built to suit that purpose. So when we were to discuss the disadvantages of HDFS, it took me a while to word it out. (You wouldn't look at a hammer and say 'One of its disadvantage is that it cannot warm up food.')
