For the first homework, I really enjoyed actually using what we learned in lecture and applying to real life scenarios provided in the homework. I enjoyed the second problem because it involved doing some real calculations, but the problem was quite difficult, especially for someone without a strong mathematical background. Even after reading the example given in the textbook, it was more difficult to understand why something was calulated the way it is than actually calculating it. It would have been better if a better explanation was given in lecture or if the homework provided more guidance. The third problem was not much reading, but it was hard to digest what the article was talking about. I have some data science knowledge before reading, but I realized if I didn't, it would be extremely difficult to pick up the underlying message that the author was trying to convey. It was a doable homework, but a little rough especially for being the very first homework.
