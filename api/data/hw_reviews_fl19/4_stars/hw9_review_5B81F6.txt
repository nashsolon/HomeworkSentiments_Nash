One of the things that scared me was that I had to write a program in python since it was a long time since I wrote a program in python. But I got hang of it and after all it was quite easy. However, I got stuck when I had to write pyspark related codes since I did not read the documentation carefully. Therefore if I could go back I will look into the documenation more carefully. I really liked this homework since I love python. The language is simple yet powerful.
