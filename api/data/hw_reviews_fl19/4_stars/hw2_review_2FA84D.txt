I did like to review general knowledge of HDFS and how the mapper and reducer work by doing some examples. 
I think knowing disadvantages and advantages of HDFS is a quite important. 
In the beginning of the class, I thought that mapreduce is like a magic that solves all problems, but it is important to understand that 
it is not quite useful in some cases.
