I like this homework because it reinforce the syntax of Hive and Spark. The problems really help me review the lecture and learn about the difference of SQL andHive SQL What I dislike the assignment is that some problems have overlapping content, which is unnecessary. If I would do this assignment again, I would use the cheatsheet provided in the lecture, that is helpful when dealing with Spark.
