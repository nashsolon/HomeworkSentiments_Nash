I like this hw4 very much. Because we learned how to use ToolRunner to specify configuration options and parameters and how to use distributed cache data. The most important thing I learned from this homework is that distributed cache can not only be used in mappers and reducers, but also in partitioners. All those methods enrich the functions of MapReduce Job and help it implement the complicated data process.
