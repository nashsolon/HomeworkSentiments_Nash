I feel pretty good with first two problems, but quite not enjoy the third problem. The first problem is what we discussed in class, and thus it is easy to catch up with. The second problem offer a great example and thus I can figure it out with some time. However, the third problem is not quite easy to understand. I get lost although I follow (or I try to follow) the paper.

If I could star over again, I would look the example in the book before I start solving problem 2. Because I spent much time on figuring out the solution without any other help.
