I liked the first part of the homework assignment where you got the chance to run a command and write the output and command as the answer. The theoretical stuff while I understand its importance I enjoyed the questions less. I do however appreciate that the questions and the readings pair together well. In the future I am going to try to switch between reading an answering the questions that way the reading is more fresh. Also I felt like some of the questions are oppinion based and am confused on what they are looking for, next time I need to ask a question in piaza to clarify.
