I thought that this homework was nice because of the SQL part of it. I used SQL every day in my job, so it was nice to be able to use my SQL skills in class. It was difficult to get used to using Python again. I like Python, but getting used to the syntax, espicially the pyspark syntax took some time (like RDD stuff). If I had to redo this again, I would make sure I am familiar with the syntax, and I would begin earlier.
