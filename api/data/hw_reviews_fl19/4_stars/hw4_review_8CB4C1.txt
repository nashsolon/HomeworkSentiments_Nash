I liked that this assignment really helped me understand how to do the code in Java via the commandline and toolrunner for differentmapreduce jobs. I found that once I got the hang of the syntax it's not that hard. The most important thing I learned is how to set parameters. I wish I had started the assignment earlier since it took me a very long time and unfortunately I did not finish.
