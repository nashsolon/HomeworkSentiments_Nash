I liked the assignment because it really forced me to understand collaborative filtering, a topic that originally confused me during lecture. One critique I have for the assignment is that Problem 1 felt largely repetitive, and I don’t think I got much out of it other than learning how to retrieve a file’s name in the Mapper and how to set an InputFormat class (both of which I did not feel like warranted an entire question on a homework). Ultimately, I found the collaborative filtering questions to be the most useful thing I learned in this homework.
