For this homework, the first two problems let me be more familiar with the spark operations.Specifically, how to load data, how to filter data, how to do mapreduce...
I very like this exercise and thinks it's very useful for my understanding to Spark andn Spark operations. The third problem lets me know how to run Spark applicationlocally, on client and on cluster. The last problem let me compare the storage efficiency difference of two data representation of PageRank algorithm, which is my favoritate part.
