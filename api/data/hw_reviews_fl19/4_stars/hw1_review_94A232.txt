i think this assignment is ok but not great. 

The first problem helps me understanding and remembering characteristics of different datasets. 
Also the d) and e) of first problem make me think differences between datasets. 

The second problem is really interesting. 
It shows something it's nearly impossible to detect a specific event.
But im not pretty sure what's the meaning of this whole model.

The third problem confuses me.
I am not sure which model or product the auther is talking about and what exact method the auther is using.
Lack of CS background could be one reason. 
Im working on master degree in Quantitative Finance but i still want to learn about data science.
So i took cse131, cse247 and sql course of Olin school.
I hope lecturer will give more practical examples so that i can understand theories better.
