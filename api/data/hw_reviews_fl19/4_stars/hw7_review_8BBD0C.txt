Overall, I think one of the things i liked the most about this homework was how problem one clearly instructed us how to implement the code. Having the repo to look at and model was also extremely useful. One thing that i think was the most important thing i learned was how to implement multiple jobs for one set of data. Especially the way you can use different jobs to implement a top n list.
