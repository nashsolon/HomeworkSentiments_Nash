Most questions in HW 9 are about the usage of Spark. Some of the questions depend on the lab 8, while the last question is about PageRank. I feel it's relatively easy compare with the former HW. I thinks this is because Spark is easier to use compare to Hadoop Java. Spark is easier not only in coding but also in running and debugging. Basically, I haven't found anything surprised me and finished this hw without meeting problems.
