I like how we use the YARN resource manager web interface to look up the statistics of our MapReduce work. In the previous work, one way for me to check these statistics is to read the output when running the work on the local. This is inefficient and maybe wrong since there are too many output showing. With the help of this web interface, we are now able to quickly get all the information we need.
I will surely go through the slides more carefully. I had a general idea of how to implement the code at the beginning, but the result seemed wrong. But after I went through all the related slides, things become more clear.
