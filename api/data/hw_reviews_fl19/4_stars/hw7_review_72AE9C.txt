I like this homework a lot, I always want to do something with real world examples, and this is it. I enjoy the process of analyzing top list for some real world data. The most important thing I learnt was how to analyze movie rating data and compute a list of the most popular movies, and the information co-occurrence based recommendations. Nothing really surprise me in this homework, because they are basically lab and lecture materials. If I could start again I would start earlier this week is extremely busy and I have only a limited amount of time to do this but I finished it on time.
