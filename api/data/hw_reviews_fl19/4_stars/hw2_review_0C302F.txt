I enjoyed doing this assignment more than the last one. This time, the reading was more easy to understand. I like problem 2 and 3 a lot because I actually felt like I was understanding the material more. They were fun problems. I didn't like the sketch of the cluster state that much. I felt like the most important thing I learned from this assignment was through the map reduce problems.
