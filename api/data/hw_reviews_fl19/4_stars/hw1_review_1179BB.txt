Generally, I like this assignment. Problem 1 let us review what we learned in class. Problem 2 and Problem 3 give us a chance of self study. The only thing that I do not like in this assignment is the 4th question in Problem 2. It asks what does it imply for sth., which made me quite confused. I do not know how to answer such broad question. 
The most important thing that I learned from this assignment is characteristics of big datasets, beacuse Problem 1 help me review this again and again.
