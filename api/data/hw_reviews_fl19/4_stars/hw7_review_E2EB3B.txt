i like the first questiong of the hw7. it was fun!
iv learned that is the communication cost memory allocation issue when comparing different algorithm. I think it is immportant because it is a very useful tips in designing algorithm for a specific problem in the future.
nothing really suprised me.
if given more time i would definitely spend more time on recommendation system algorithms and get a deeper understanding of them.
