I like the homework because it is quite practical and useful. However, I think the work load is too heavy for a weekly homework, so I dislike it.
I felt surprised when I found that the runtime of such a big file is not as long as I expect when using cloud computing.
I will make full use of the lab section to make the process clear for me next time I do it.
