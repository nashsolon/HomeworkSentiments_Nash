What I like about this assignment is that the instructions for code design of Problem 1 and Problem 2 are very concise. The instructions said clearly what we need to do to reach out our experiment goal. Some questions are used to guide us a deeper understanding on the    essence of the structure of the work.
The most important thing I learned is the advantage of secondary sort than the naive solution by grouping by key and sorted in Reducer. I think the secondary sort method is very clever which using the property of MapReduce to sort the values by particular key, which saves a lot of time and memory than sorting in Reducer.
