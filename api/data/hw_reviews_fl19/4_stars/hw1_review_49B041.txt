I like some part of this assignment. Like the first two problems. I learned what is the basic information about big data during the class. Through the assignments, I can understand the basic definition better. As for the second problem, I think this problem helps me work better in Mapreduce. I can better design a algorithm. But the last one, to read a paper and get some information makes feel itâ€™s a paper work, not about how to code, how to think. Only some other basic idea about big data.

Actually, in the article that the unlabeled data are more useful amazed me. I always believe that a structed data can be used better, and it is much easier for people to utilize. But I realize that although structed data are easy to handle, it can only bring limited information.
