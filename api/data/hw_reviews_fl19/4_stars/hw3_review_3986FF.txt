This one is probably one of the bestest I've had. It has some proper reviews that ask me to go over the slides, yet won't take loads of time to extract something from an essay. Moreover, I personally feel that all the questions are intended to help me learn something from old lectures, which is what I appreciate. Please do more of this, thanks.
