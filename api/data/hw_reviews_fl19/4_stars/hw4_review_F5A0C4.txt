This homework was very informative and showed us how to use ToolRunner to run mapreduce on the commandline with distributed cache. I liked the hands-on coding assignment, and learned a lot on how to write and run a program from scratch. The most important thing for me was learning how to use side data to inform my mapreduce program, as this could have many applications in research and so on. If I could start over, I would have looked back on previous labs and used them as a resouce in conjunction with the slides (from lab and in class).
