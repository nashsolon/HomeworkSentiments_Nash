I think this assignment really further my understanding for the YARN, some bottlenecks and some method we come up to deal with it. Sometimes, these procedures in the real machine are so abstract that I may skip many details in the class. But the assigenment really cover mamy details I ignore and the time I spent on is much more than I expected. Also, problem 1 greatly stengthen our practice and hand on skills for the lab.
