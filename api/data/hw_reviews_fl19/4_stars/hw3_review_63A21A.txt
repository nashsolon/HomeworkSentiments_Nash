I like the concept questions in this assignment that makes me reviewing the lecture slides and clarifying some important concepts that didn't covered in class. For example skew and data locality. But for the question about sentimental analysis, I think providing us the link of wikipedia is a confusing because it's hardto find it related to the Word Count example. The most important thing I learnedis the MapReduce Job Execution process. I read the textbook and learned more about the difference of MapReduce 1.0 and 2.0. It's helpful to understand why they are adapting the second structure.
