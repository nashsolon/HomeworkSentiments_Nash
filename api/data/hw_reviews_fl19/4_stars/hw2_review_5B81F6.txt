I really liked the fact that we went over lab1 while doing the homework since now I finally understood what we were doing in lab1. Thinking about how hadoop works and how data nodes are used and how size of blocks matter to the system than we may think was quite fruitful. Also, although I already had some knowledge about map reducing, I finally understood how each step works and why they are needed. One thing that I did not completely understood was what is the disadvantage for having a large size block. I thought that since each block is now large, the processing time will increase since processing rate is always fixed. If I could start this homework over again, I would first read the textbook very carefully since I was stuck with some questions in the first problem. I soon realized that most of questions were explained in the textbook. So that's where I will go first if I had to start again.
