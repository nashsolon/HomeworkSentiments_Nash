For HW5, I like Problem 2 and 3 the best because these questions requires reading of the textbook and understanding of basic knowledge of collaborative ratings. The most important thing that I learned is different approaches to calculate the collaborative ratings. It is interesting that to achieve a more accurate calculation, we can manipulate all the ratings (such as give them a threshold).
