I really like this assignment, for two reasons as indicated: first, the first problem is about coding, which definitely improve my coding skills and also had a more deeper understanding about how driver, mapper and reducer connect to each other and work together. Secondly, it is because rest of two problems, it requires a solid conceptual understanding about the similarity measures using different methods like Jaccard similarity ,cosine similarity and Pearson correlation. I learned how to use it under different situations and the differences among them. 
Assuming I could start over again, I will spent more time studying the materials about how to calculate similarity measures under different situations because at first when I stared to do it, I did it as what I think at the first place, so I made a lot of mistakes and then had to rework it for a long time. So if I could start again, I will learn more before starting doing it.
