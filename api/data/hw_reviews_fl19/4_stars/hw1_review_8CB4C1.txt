I liked that this assignment further explored concepts taught in lecture such as the characteristics of Big Data. I also like that the readings were included in the homework and I enjoyed the article "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data." I disliked that Bonferroni's Principle was not introduced in class yet, but it was nice that we were told the section of the textbook to refer to. If I had to start over, I would give myself more time to complete the assignment (especially when I realized I should use Latex).
