I liked the opportunity to use SQL (or, more accurately, Hive) in this lab as SQL is an extremely practical language to know and be able to effectively use for both Business Analysts and Data Analysts. I disliked how vague the questions for Problem 5 were (for example: "Which SPARk operation can be used to map the information in the second value to separate RDD elements?" was an awful question). The most important thing I learned was about understanding RDDs and their functionality (including pipelining) although I had to figure most of this out for myself since the lectures were largely unhelpful.
