What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?



I like the problem 2. I’d love to deal with this kind of interesting math problems. And the example provided by the question is very practical. On the other hand, I slightly dislike the problem 3. I always believe reading paper is an arduous thing and it’s not possible to understand everything in a short time (it seems we read it for the 25 points).



Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?



I would like to start with my partner earlier than before. Because for the problem 1 and problem 3, there was a lot of things could be done much easier by teamwork. Especially for the paper reading part.
