As usual, I liked this assignment. I think what stood out was the question about skew. It was nice to have a question that had real-world implications. At work, our data science group had to talk about skew and how certain tables created had high levels of skew, with some having skew values in the 80s-90s due (most likely) to not using unique identifiers as keys. It was nice to have this real-world intuition help to answer this question. Relating to this, I think it was nice to learn more about the technical aspects of skew and how it related to Hadoop architecture. Like the other assignments, I appreciated how there was some real-world connections. While I finished this assignment on-time, I think I would have liked to start the assignment earlier.
