This homework was mostly good. I like problem 1 since I think that coding should be central to every computer science class. I found problem 2 pretty frustrating since you had to put so much in your calculator. I was very afraid that I was going to make a small typo while entering into my calculator and get the wrong answer and thus have the TA mark me down harshly as they often do. Furthermore, I had no clue how much work I was supposed to show as typing equations in latex can be tedious.
