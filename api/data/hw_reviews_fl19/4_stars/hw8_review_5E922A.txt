The most interesting thing about this homework for me was that there was an opportunity to explore HIVE and Spark in order to create data analysis programs. 
My least favorite thing was that there was too little direction in the last problem in the homework, and I felt like I just had to try to pick unfamiliar functions out of the Spark API to try to solve the problem.
