I would say the second and third part are more user-friendly, as they ask questions about applications with real-world scenes. Moreover, they are shorter than the first part of the assignment. For the first part, it asks about theoretical stuff, and I have to go over the materials over and over. I think the perfect strategy is to memorize all about the details before I even start.
