This homework was helpful because it improved my understanding of the MapReduce process.  I especially liked the problem about the work process and locality really because it helped me understand the process. The most surprising thing I learned during this homework is the fact that when doing a map task, data can be stored/processed locally.  I just did not think of cloud computing to be capable of working locally and on the network at the same time.  If I can start this assignment again, I would look deeper into YARN scheduler. Because I did not understand it well, I was lost where to find the information about it in the slide and when I found it, I still had a difficult time understanding it.
