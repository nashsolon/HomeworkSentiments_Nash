Overall, this homework was enjoyable. I liked the first two problems. P1 made us think about the data and how to model it with data structures. P2 was an interesting probability question that extended beyond the example, and it was very rewarding when I solved it. The article was abit difficult to read and the P3 questions were abit ambiguous, so it took me a long time. The Bonferroni Principle was definitely the most surprisingly. I sort of had an intuition of the principle before this homework, but never knew it had a name. This principle was also the most important thing I learned because I will be able to better understand occurances of events of interests in large datasets in the future. If I were to start over this homework again, I would spread out doing the P3 article questions over several days, so that my mind can disgust the article more.
