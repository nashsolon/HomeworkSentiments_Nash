I like the second problem since I get a clearer and deeper understanding of partitioner. Actually, I am a little confused about this concept before I do this homework. Sometimes, we have to admit that practice will promote us get a better master of knowledge. Besides, the code sometimes might fail and this makes me a little upset and decide to have a late extension. I hope I can do better in further homework and project!
