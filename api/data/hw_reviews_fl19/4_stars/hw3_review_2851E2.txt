I feel like the most important thing I leanred was where different tasks are executed in the context of locality optimization. I feel like it is very important to understand not only how these tasks execute, but also where they do so. Knowing this can be helpful with identifying where bottlenecks can occur. If I had to start over again, I would not have deleted the output of the shakespeare wordcount when I finished lab2. Doing so made the time it took to complete this assignment much longer.
