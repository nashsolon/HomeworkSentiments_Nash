work is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of spark shell and write a spark program. I do learn more about the general procedure of how to write a spark program and how to play around with spark shell, etc. I don't really like questions that ask about where is the driver executed, where is the processing and where is the result stored. I think they are kind of vague and I don't know what the question is looking for.
