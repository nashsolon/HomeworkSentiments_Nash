What I donâ€™t like about this assignment is the inconsistence of similarity definition between the MMDS and slides. Since we used a different definition of similarity at the courses, I think we should distinguish it from the definition on the textbook. But in this assignment, there are no hints or tips to explain such difference and which one we should use. So I think this is a miss for instructors who is responsible for this assignment.
The most important thing I learned is that the similarity method is not a very good way to reveal the difference of users. Since there are many aspects that influence rating, so we can not use simple similarity measure (cosine, Jaccard) to represents the difference between users.
