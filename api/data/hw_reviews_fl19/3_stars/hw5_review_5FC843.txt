Overall i found this lab extremely interesting. It was mostly coding based so I preferred problem 1. Problem 2 was kind of annoying since it was more theoretical. It involved using mathematic similarity and it was kind of tedious. Problem 3 was also not coding based so i didn't like it as much. I learn more when we apply what we learned via code instead of theoretically. I think it cements it in my head more and therefore I am more likely to retain. Also I wish there was less write ups and more just coding.
