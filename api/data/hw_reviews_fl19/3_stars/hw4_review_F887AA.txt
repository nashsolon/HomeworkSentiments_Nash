 This homework was definitely more challenging than the other ones. I liked the fact that we got to work with very technical parts of mapreduce, but once all the topics we discussed in class piled up, it started to confuse me. I had to spend quite some time trying to figure out which setup and initialization goes where. Of course, this was after I had to deal with the VM problem, because the metadata for eclipse somehow got messed up and had to restart from scratch (lab0). After reading through the instructions in the homework several times, it became clearer what I'm supposed to do, and from there I could fix the coding problems I had. 
Certainly, this homework took a lot longer than the other three, but was very worth it. The more time I spent on it, the better understanding of the MapReduce process and the details such as dirver, setup methods, partitioner, and distributed files.
