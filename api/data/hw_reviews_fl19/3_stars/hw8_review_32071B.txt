Homework 8 is about the practice of HIVE and SPARK. Both of them are methods of process big data. The problems themselves are not hard, but I feel some of the problems are not clearly clarified. For example, 3(d), I don't think the question make sense (either it's too easy or I missed something). I asked TA about this question, he has no clue too. I feel I may not get full score, but it's not my fault. Another thing is that, when I write HIVE statement, I found out there are different ways to get the same solution. Maybe we should learn more about HIVE statement in class. I mean the functions which can improve the efficiency, not the easy SELECT statement.
