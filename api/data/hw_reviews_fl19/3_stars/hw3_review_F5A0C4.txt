I enjoyed learning about the various optimizations involved throughout the MapReduce process, including concepts such as parallelism and data locality optimization. One thing I disliked was the inconsistency in the terminology from the book and from class, including the mix-ups between general MapReduce systems and the specific Hadoop MapReduce system. If I could start the homework again, I would review my class notes first and draw out the various components and phases of the MapReduce system, and get a clearer high-level picture first, before attempting the more conceptual questions in the homework.
