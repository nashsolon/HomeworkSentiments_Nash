I like the problem 3. I also tracked its references to read other articles related to this issue. The most interesting one is the original paper, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in Natural Sciences. However, I think it's better to contain some comments on this article to show what it's really about. I saw the author responded how others misinterpreted his ideas. Comparison may also highlight the meaningful part of the article.

The most important things I learned are about how mathematics influences research and how a huge amount of data changes the way people design algorithms. I think it's important to knows what roles the tools one uses play in his research. When he decides which tool to use, which direction he should research, which knowledge he should learn, he should have an inside map. Sometimes I'm confused if I should believe almost all life questions can be solved in mathematical way, like some AI scientists believe. I'm also confused what this data-oriented approaches will go to. Now I have some thoughts.
