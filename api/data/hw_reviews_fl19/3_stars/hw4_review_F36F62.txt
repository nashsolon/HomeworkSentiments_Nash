I made a mistake on split() method. I originally used “ “ to split. It pass the test locally because there is only one line of string and the test was too short. But When I test it with a bigger test I wrote on Hadoop. The code get wrong answer. It turns out I used the wrong RegX. I should use \\w+ instead of a single blank space. I should take look at the regular expression since I haven’t use them a lot.
