What I don’t like about this homework is because the indistinct instructions of Problem 3. First of all, in the very first version of this homework, Problem 3(a) gave a wrong link for reference of the necessary option, which really wasted too much time for me to find the operation which does not exist. Secondly, the instruction of Problem 3(d) is not clear and inconsistent. I hope next time, we can have a direct and correct instruction to help us go through the homework.
If I could start over again, I will firstly update the homework to the newest version. Since I don’t know that there are so many things to be fixed in a homework instruction, I simply believed it and wasted too much time.
