I thought this homework was quite difficult. I could not do part e and f of question 2. But I enjoyed the link representation problem the best. It really made me think of storage and efficiency. I enjoyed learning how to use map and reduce functions in python in this homework and on previous homeworks. I wished I started on this homework earlier because I started on the last day, but still managed to be able to finish it. It's sad it's the last homework that we have. I wish there was more programming in this homework. It was a very real world experience as we had to analyze weblog data.
