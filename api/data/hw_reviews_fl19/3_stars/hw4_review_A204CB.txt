Harder than I thought. Many times just work on small problems, such as how to set the partitioner and let it work, how to let the code read the negative and positive file correctly, how to split the reducers. It is a bit annoying, since I know how it works, but do not know how to let it work. There is a big gap knowing how and doing how. Beyond that, I still have many questions about the structure itself. How does the partitioner pick the task just based on a few lines of code? How does the toolrunner works? Do we need to add toolrunner to do local debug? How to let eclipse running under debog mode, so I can see their output? There are a lot of confusing parts about this course. And I feel I just working on "following the code of slices".
