this homework wasn't so bad. I enjoyed doing the third problem 3 the most. I thought it was quite tedious but I learned alot from it. Problem 1 was also quite easy. Nothing in this homework really surprised me as it was straightforward. If I were to restart, I would have done this homework much sooner and learn it in earlier. The most annoying part of this homework was you had to change that int to longs in the sumreducer, was very annoying. should have just made the files all ints. maybe thats something marion can do to change this homework.
