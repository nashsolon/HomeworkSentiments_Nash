I feel that this homework assignment was little bit lengthy and difficult. The map reduce program we have learnt so far were little different from this inverted index problem.I had to spend lot of time understading the flow of the map reduce program. The other thing I have learnt from this homework is the various measures of similarity.The calculations had taken quit some time to solve but the over all concept was easy and simple.On the whole I find this assignment a little tougher especially the programming component compared to the previous homeworks.
