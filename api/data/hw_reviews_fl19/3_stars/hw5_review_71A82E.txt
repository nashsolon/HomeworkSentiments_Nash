I do not like the coding part of the homework as there includes a package that was not mentioned in the class. We should have a library or appendex for introducing these libraries. It takes a huge amount time to find a pre-build funciton, which is meaningless. Also for problem 2 the function on slides is wrong, according to both textbook and other resources we can find online. Thus would like to hear some justification.
