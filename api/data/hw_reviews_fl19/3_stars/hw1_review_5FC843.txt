Overall I like the first problem of the assignment. It made me practice what I have learned in class and forced me to look back at the slides to remind myself about the characteristics of big data. Problem 3 I did not like because the questions were more arbitrary. They weren't really asking about specific things covered in the text but about larger questions. They were more difficult to answer and personally did not feel like it helped me better understand the information. It was more regurgitating what the article said but did not improve comprehension. I think the most important thing I learned is the characteristics of big data because it taught me to consider what the data is being used for and what the advantages and disadvantages of it are. Problem 2 surprised me as it made me recall some of the work i did in my prior statistics class that I seemingly thought was irrelevant. It definitely pushed me to remember and improve on my math ability.
