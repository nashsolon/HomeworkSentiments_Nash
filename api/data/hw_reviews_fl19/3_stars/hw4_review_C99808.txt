Overall I learned a lot from this homework. I enjoyed analyzing words and sentiment. I wish there was a little more guidance on this homework as it was our first time using eclipse doing this mapreduce stuff. I was surprised there was intially bugs in the homework problems. Most important thing I learned is that sentiment statistics can be quite misleading as it considers a lot of words to be neutral. If I were to restart this assigment, I would definitely start it much earlier. We started it late, and getting stuck on a bug was real stressful.
