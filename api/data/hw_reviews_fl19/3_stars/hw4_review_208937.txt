This assignment is much difficult than the previous ones, which took me a lot of time to complete. And during the process, I tried all kinds of methods to fix it, it is really annoying at that time.
However, I think I also learned how to fix various problems when coding because not everyone will face same coding problems, so we have to fixed it by ourselves, by asking professor for help or google it by self. I think that is the most important part I learned from this assignment.
