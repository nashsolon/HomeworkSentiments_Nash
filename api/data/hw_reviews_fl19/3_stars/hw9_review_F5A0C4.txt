I disliked the open-ended nature of this assignment and the lack of clear instructions for various questions. The material covered in class was helpful at times, but seemed disorganized and it was unclear where to look for information to help us in the assignment. I did learn important concepts such as RDD transformation and creating spark programs, and thought it was useful to implement a Spark program from scratch. In the future, I Would organize the information from the slides before attempting the questions, so I can be better prepared to know where to look for help.
