I like the assignment because it is build on previous code and implements partio
ner and distributed cache. However I feel that we didn't cover much details in t
he lecture and lab, so it's difficult for me to find out how to access distribut
ed cache in the partitioner class. If I could start over again, I would test the
code locally before run it on HDFS, because it is a waste of time to compile the
code into jar and delete it.
