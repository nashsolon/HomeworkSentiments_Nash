One of the important things I learned from this homework is how to use different type of input format
based on the form of the data available to us. Each line in this input file contains a line number and a line of text, 
separated by a tab. By using the KeyValueInputFormat, we can easily make the line number as the key and the text as
the value.

One thing I don't like about this assignment is the similarity part since I feel some of the questions are kind of ambiguous.
Like when we calculate Jaccard Similarity in the new way, we spent a lot of time to find out whether two user's ratings for
one element should be counted if there are different, but there is no clear explaination in either the slides or the textbook.
