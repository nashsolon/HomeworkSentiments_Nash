I would say I really prefer coding over doing other things, especially for this course because I believe coding could be a more solid training for the contents instead of just memorizing all these articles. I would say the best part is always the first part, as it does not require that much effort. Even though I got itwrong in the beginning, I could still manage to get it through with help from my teammate.
