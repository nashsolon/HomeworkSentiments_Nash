The most importing thing I learn from this homework is that understanding things doesn’t mean you can do it well, there are gaps. Before I actually working on this homework, I thought it would be easy since I have already know all the concept. However, when I actually started , problems and bugs just keep jumping out. While most bugs are just because of my carelessness, dealing with them is quite time and energy consuming. After this homework, I realized that I am still an elementary programmer, and there are lot of space of me to improve. 
What I don’t like about this assignment is that the instructions on the slides are too vague to understand the code and framework. I think we should add more comments on the code to understand the actual usage of each line of code. It is really not friendly for the beginner of Hadoop like me.
