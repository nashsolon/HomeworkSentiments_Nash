I liked writing the entire mapreduce implementation from scratch for WordCo. I felt like it was a good way to get an even better understanding of mapreduce and custom writablecomparables. If I could start over on this assignment, I would have done the lab 4 and 5 optional parts before working on the code and writeup for homework 6, as it would have made the assignment go much smoother for me.
