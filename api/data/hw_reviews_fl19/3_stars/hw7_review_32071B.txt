Homework 7 concerns about lab 6(top n list), definition and usage of combiner, and co-occurrence computation. Is the hardest one I have done. It take efforts to do the coding, read the log and do the calculation based on the log. For example, in lab 6, we spend a lot of time on the Practical Development rather than the coding. So, I find there are different ways to do the coding, like there are different ways to run two jobs in sequence. I would love to know which way of doing coding is the best, and why is the best. As for the problem 3, I feel like if the MapReduce Job log are talked about and showed in the class, I can solve the problem faster. Although this homework takes me more time, I do feel it's a good review and practice of what I learnt.
