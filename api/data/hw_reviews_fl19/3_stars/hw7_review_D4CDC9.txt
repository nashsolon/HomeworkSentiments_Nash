I liked the majority of this assignment. I thought that question one was pretty stimulating, but I found myself slightly frustrated because the example code that was given used a tree map for no reason when a priority queue would be much better. I used a priority queue, ignoring the example. The last question I did not enjoy because it required you to reference the information from the lecture slides, but the lecture slides are rather lacking.
