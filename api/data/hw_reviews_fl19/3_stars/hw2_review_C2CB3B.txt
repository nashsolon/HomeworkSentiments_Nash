My biggest complaint with HW2 was with the text mentions in problem 1. The online copy of HTDG has no page numbers, so finding the mentioned pages in the hints (e.g. 43-45) was impossible. It would be much more helpful to have a very specific phrase at which to start reading. I thought the second and third problem are the most helpfl since they are more practical then the first. What surprised me was how the HTDG text had no page numbers, and that the passages mentioned were very vague/not helpful at times. If I could do the homework differently I would work mor eintensively one problem one and ask the professor or a TA whether or not the passage I was looking at for problem 1 was indeed the correct one to lookat.
