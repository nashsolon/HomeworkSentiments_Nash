I liked writing my own spark program, but I still was not satisfied with the long time of execution. Locally, the jobs executed somewhat reasonably, but in cluster mode they took several minutes. The most important thing I learned was probably to make sure I had everything in the right place, named properly, and the dependencies in order. I was surprised by some of the execution speed, although I should not have been because it was a large dataset. If I could start over again, I would write everything out before diving right in and trying the different commands.
