The part of the assignment that I liked the most was the mathematical derivation. This surprised me, as I usually don't enjoy doing those in a computer science class, but working through the problem and finding the correct answer was very satisfying. The part I disliked was the reading of the paper and the questions that accompanied it. I feel like there are better ways to learn about computer science subjects than what is essentially reading comprehension. I do, however, think that the knowledge I gained from the paper was the most important/interesting part of the assignment. I just don't find answering comprehension questions about research papers to be worthwhile.
