I really do not like this homework or I do not feel good when doing this. It does covered all the materials but there are many detailed problem. Firstly, the page number in the hint for the reading material are wrong, which wasted me a lot of time. Secondly, there a a lot of pronoun in the homework that is really messay, I can only write down everything that related and try to hit the target, which is bad.
