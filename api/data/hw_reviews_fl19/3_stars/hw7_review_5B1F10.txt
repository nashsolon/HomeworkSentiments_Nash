I liked the opportunity to code in this assignment, as it advanced my understanding of the particular MapReduce algorithms and programs we discussed in class. Specifically, I felt implementing the word co-occurrence program for Problem 3 was useful to my understanding and made me more comfortable with that algorithm. However, I did not like the questions regarding communication cost, as it was confusing and hard to determine which counter statistics in the YARN Resource Manager were the correct ones to use, and the instructions on that subject were vague at best. If I could start over, I would start the assignment earlier so as to be able to dedicate more time to answering the written questions.
