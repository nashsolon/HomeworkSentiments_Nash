I would say this one was a little bit difficult for me. The last half was OK, but it seems that the coding part was a little bit of headache, as looking for the exact InputFormat was really a headache. However, after that, things got much easier, and I would conclude that this one was not hard. If I have prepared well, it would probably onl take me about 2.5 hours or more.
