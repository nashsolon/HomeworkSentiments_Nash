I enjoyed doing the math problem, but I wished there had been more coding involved. I also disliked the article reading and questions because they seemed unclear or unrelated to the rest of the course material. I learned that false positives are much more likely than we would expect. I wish I had more time to ask a TA questions about the article we had to read.
