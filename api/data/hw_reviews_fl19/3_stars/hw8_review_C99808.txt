overall this homework was enjoyable. I liked that I got to learn how to use spark and hive. the sql was challenging because it involved a subquery. the spark was challenging as I had to figure out how to use the three functions that were provided. I would have tried to refresh my sql more if I could restart this homework. This homework was not too hard as it didn't involve java coding, which I liked. This homework was very real world as we got to analyze some data and put it into a database we created. It was overall fun and few negatives.
