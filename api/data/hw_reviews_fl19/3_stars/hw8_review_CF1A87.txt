1. I choose the third question. When I do question 3, I am so surprised that the HiveQL can do such complicated analysis. It can help check out which part is wrong and fix it. Also, the time that it takes is very fast.

2. Assuming I could get another chance, I think I would start doing this homework as early as possible. This time's workload is a little bit heavy. It takes me around one whole day to finish it. If I started earlier, I could get more time to think.
