 • What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?

	I like how we can review what we learned from class, and I like there are some calculation question because I like numbers
	
	I partially don’t like the first question because it doesn’t have a standard right or wrong question, it’s very flexible so I am worry about how that is going to affect my score

 • What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so? 

	I think that one of the most important things I learned is how to distinguish type of data, what does it mean to say big data applications and characteristics of data. I think this is vital because it helps me have this mind map that can quickly sort the data in the real world situation.


• What surprised you, and why? 
	I'm surprised that I have to read that essay for at least 4 times to get a hold of basic idea, and then 3 times more to extract information. I thought data and cloud computing concepts are supposed to be all about numbers and calculations, that's why I'm trapped in this essay and overwhelmed by all these concepts that I was trying to mind map.
	
	

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?First, I would definitely read the question 3 first and then go into reading the long essay, because that would be easier if I remember what I came for. Second, I would go for the textbook to check what it says about question 2.
