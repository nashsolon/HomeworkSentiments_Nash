I like the problem 1-2 but no problem 3. Problem 1-2 are closely related to the class, while problem 3 seems not. Probably, moving problem 3 to later HW will be more helpful. I think the most important thing I learned is the characteristics of big data because problem 2 is only a statistic question and I did not have a good understanding of the article in problem 3. Bonferroniâ€™s Principle suprised me because even in completely random datasets, you can expect particular events of interest to occur with a big enough dataset.
