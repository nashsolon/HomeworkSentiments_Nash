I was surprised by the fact that a simple change to the job configurations in the command line can entirely change how the output is sorted, as reflected in problem 2 part (c). If I could start this assignment over again, I would start earlier so as to give myself more time to process the material covered in it and better understand it. I liked the opportunity to code again in this assignment, but I disliked the reliance on Lab 5 in multiple of the questions.
