Generally, I think this homework is too much. We really spent a lot of time doing this homework. But the good thing about this homework is that the description of the problem is clearer than the last homework. We learned how to use SPARK in this homework. It is annoying that whenever we closed a terminal by mistake, we had to start all over again.
