This homework was an alright homework. There were certainly parts I enjoyed but parts that took some time to figure out. The first two parts with spark was a cool way to see how to transform the data into something that we would want and using that info to analyze user behavior. The third question was quite confusing in trying to figure out where all the data was stored and where all the processes were done. We're still not completely sure if we were right on our choices, but we tried out best. The last question was cool. Overall, this homework was one that just needed to be done with and pass. Didn't love it but didn't hate it either.
