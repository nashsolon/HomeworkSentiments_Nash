What I like about the assignment is that it helps me to have a deep and thorough understanding on the five characteristics of big data. By searching for statistics of the three different big datasets, I realized that the term “big” is not easy to obtain, and this process changes my view on big datasets. What I dislike about the assignment is that the article given in Problem 3 is not easy to read and extract explicit information from it. I agree that learning from outside reading is a good way to absorb various point of view. But there are so many other irrelevant information and I am wondering if it is worthy.
What surprised me mostly is the definition of “big” data. Previously I thought that the web data are all very huge because web is a huge platform for people worldwide providing information. But the characteristics of big data is not easy to be present at the same time. For example, we know that the amount of Wikipedia articles is large, but the average size of a single article is small. From this homework, I just learned that the definition of big data has multiple aspects and we need to know that different datasets have different aspects that denotes “big” in order to analyze them better.
