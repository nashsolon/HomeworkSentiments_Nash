In general, I think this homework is okay(better than the last homework). I like problem 2 and problem 3, which is a good review of what we have learned in class. The code problem is also okay, not too hard nor too easy. But problem 1 is quite confusing. Even after we finish writing the code part, we still do not know how to answer these questions.
