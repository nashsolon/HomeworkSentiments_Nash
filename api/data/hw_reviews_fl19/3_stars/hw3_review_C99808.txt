The most important thing I learned is the skew. I learned a lot about how reducers function in this homework. One thing I would have done differently is to use the grep command to find the word frequency for problem 1, as suggested by the TA. I just manually scrolled up and down which took a long time.I liked the sentiment analysis question as I thought it was quite thought provoking. I liked how most of the knowledge you need to do this assignment.
