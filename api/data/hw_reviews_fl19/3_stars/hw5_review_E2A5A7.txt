In this assignment, I liked the coding section. I think it was
an interesting problem and i liked that we hadn't gone through
an exact example in class so we had to really think about it.
In this assignment, I did not like that there were some
discrepancies with calculating some of the similarities.
The textbook treats calculating jaccard similarity a bit different 
to how we wanted to treat it. 

The most important thing I learned from this homework assignment is the 
advantage and disadvantage of using the different types of similarity
calculations. For example, pearsson may produce the most intuitively 
correct results for movie ratings, but it is also the most memory 
intensive and slowest. It's important to know these tradeoffs because
cost / effectiveness is a realworld practical issue that always needs
to be considered.
