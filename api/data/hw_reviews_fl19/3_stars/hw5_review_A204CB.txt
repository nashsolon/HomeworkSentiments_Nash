Hard time. I had an exam before this homework, so I have to use the late policy. For the code part, I feel confused about bugs. LongWritable, Textwritable, setinputformat, textinputformat, text.class, so many different function and types I do not know how they works. The idea it self is not hard, just find a line, use the method the book told you, convert them to text and write into result. The most annoying part is matching the type and class. Why are there so many types? Text is different from textinput, mapre.keyvalueinput is different from mapreduce.keyvalueinput, and cannot directly convert. InputSplit can be generated from input context, but it does not have the .getPath().getName, so I have to convert it to FileSplit. And Name from FileSplit is not text. Who can remember that? And I do not know how to get only the map input, and some times it is always map 100% reduce 0% without telling you what happened. And hadoop part acts slower than the eclipse part, do not know why. Exporting to .jar file works only if you did not set its entrance class, do not know why. Driver to Mapper part always have type matching problem, do not know why. And, after 80% of the code is finished, win10 update, and VMware cannot be opened anymore. I have to download a new version, restart computer for multiple times and get back to the cloudera. WTF. If I become a justice, I will rule that automatic update is illegal.
