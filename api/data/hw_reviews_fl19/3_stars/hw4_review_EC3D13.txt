I do not like this problem 2 of this homework. I am not familiar with Java and have to spend a lot of time learning it. It really takes me a long time. Though I do not like problem 2, the overall assignment is interesting. The most important thing that I learned from this assignment is the partitioner. If I could start it over again, I will try to catch up on the java requirement first.
