I don't really like this assignment. First of all, there are too many questions in this homework assignment comparing to other ones. Secondly, some of the questions are really confusing. For example, I have no idea what I need to do with the third question. Is the dataset wrong or what? Thirdly, the fifth question involving SPARK implementation is quite disappointing because there are no labs or delicate instructions besides the "not so organized" powerpoint. One thing makes this homework assignment better off than the others is probably no codes are required.
