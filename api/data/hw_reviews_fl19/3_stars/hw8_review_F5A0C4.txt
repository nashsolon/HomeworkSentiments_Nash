I liked learning big data applications of tools other than Hadoop, including Spark and Hive. It was interesting to see how efficient Spark and Hive were to producing mapreduce jobs as compared to Hadoop. I disliked the unclear nature of the homework instructions for this lab, and it was very confusing to know what the question expected us to do. The most important thing I learned was how to use Spark to create various RDDS and perform the correct transformations.
