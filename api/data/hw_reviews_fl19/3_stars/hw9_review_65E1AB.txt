I liked that this assignment forced me to learn about staging and repartitioning (a topic that confused me for a while). However, I felt like the assignment dragged on for a bit too long. I also think the wording for problem 2 is confusing. At first, I didn’t realize what the problem meant when it said to get only the html requests until I got to question 3 about jpg requests. At that point, I had to go back and redo all of problem 2 (I thought it was talking about HTTP requests, in general). I feel like this could be cleared up, and it’s easily what I would do differently if I had to do this again.
