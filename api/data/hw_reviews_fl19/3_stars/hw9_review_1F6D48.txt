I thought that this homework was a nice tour of spark commands. As the key user of the final project, it very well prepared me for my responsibilites. It was a struggle to understand the directed acyclic graph part, as the question was kind of misleading. I think that if I were to do this again, I would re-study the DAG part of the spark and Page Rank jobs. Overall, I thought that this homework was very helpful, but also very tedious. There were a lot of places where things could go awry.
