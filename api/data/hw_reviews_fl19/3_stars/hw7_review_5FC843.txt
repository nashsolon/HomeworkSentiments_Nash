Overall this hw was the best one we had. Problem 3 was a bit boring but problem 1 involved a bunch of coding and it was a continuation of the lab which I liked. Combiners are still confusing and I think we should talk about that more in class because the slides didnt have much on it. Other than that, I think that I have been given a better understanding of map reduce. That being said I'm ready to move on to different things other than map reduce. Like can we please cover other things in this class I dont feel like Im learning that much. I do like to code though.
