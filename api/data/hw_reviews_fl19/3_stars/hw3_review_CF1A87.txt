1.What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I like problem two best. By answering these questions, I can know the differences between these cases and and in each case how would skew be reduced or aggravated.

2.Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?
I would start this assignment as soon as possible. Out of procrastination, I didn't completed my homework until now, which makes me stressed and frustrated. Also, I don't have time to go through the readings and doing the review.
