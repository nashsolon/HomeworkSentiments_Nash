I like the first 3 questions of Q1 and Q2 of this assignment. Q1(a)(b)(c) ask about the 5 characteristics and can practice my understanding of big data. However, (d) and (e) are a little bit ambiguous and I don¡¯t really know what they are asking for. Q2 is also a very solid question where I can have clear logic and practice getting a formula for big data. In contrast, Q3 is more conceptual and the article doesn¡¯t really answer much of the question so I am also unsure what it is asking for.

When I am reading the article for Q3, it kind of surprises me that we are actually using a huge amount of unlabeled data to train model instead of generating natural language rules. This makes me keep thinking of how human beings learn language and comparing that to the machine. What leads to this difference? Is it possible to let machine think and learn as human? I think we are still on our way of exploring those questions.
