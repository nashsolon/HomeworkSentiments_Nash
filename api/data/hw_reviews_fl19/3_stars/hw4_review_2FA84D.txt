I really liked to code the logic for average length mapreduce program since it was pretty straightforward and I learned how mapreduce is working. 
Sentiment partitioner was also fun too. Reason why I liked those is because hw4 was the first coding assignment we have. I prefer coding to learning theory.
I think correctly setting up the mapper function is really important in mapreduce program since I have met some edge cases when using scanner instead of 
bufferedreader when reading string.
