Overall this homework was pretty easy. The similary score calculations were tedious and I thought they were unncessary. The coding problem was short but kinda tricky. I was surprised to learn the advantages and disadvantages of jaccard similary. Also I was surprised to learn that the cosine similary normalized is the same as a the person correlation. I never thought of that before. I enjoy learning what an inverted index is. Starting over I would have started the coding much sooner. I learned it's still very difficult to find which users are most similarusing the similary measures
