I liked this homework since we were actually able to write real code. Writing an actual mapper and reducer allowed me to finally put everything that I learned in class into perspective. I learned how a program takes in the data, parses it, and processes it. Comparing the differences in code before and after adding in the Toolrunner and setup functions to take in parameters was really cool. I wasn't too surprised by anything. I didn't like how slow, laggy, and difficult the VM was when I was using it. The assignment is cool, but the interface made it really not enjoyable unfortunately.
