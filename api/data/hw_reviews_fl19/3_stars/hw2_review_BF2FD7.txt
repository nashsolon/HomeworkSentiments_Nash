What is the most important thing I learned and why I think so:
Through the assignment, I have found out some of my misunderstandings about the topics from lecture, and corrected them immediately. And, the assignment also help me to review the knowledge from lecture.

Assuming I could start over again, what would I do differently:
I think I would first review the slides and read the paper carefully first, since that might save me a lot more time.
