This homework's third part was a bit confusing as I am not so familiar with python. The homework required us to write a python code to search and count for the JPG requests. However, once I understood the coding part, the rest was rather easy.  The second part of the homework was dreadful but it helped us understand spark DAG and commands. The question on PageRank was a bit disappointing. I wished to delve more into PageRank but questions were quite shallow.
