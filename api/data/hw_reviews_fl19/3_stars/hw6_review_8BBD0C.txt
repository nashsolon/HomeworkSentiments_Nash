Overall i think one of the things that i disliked about the homework is that the second and third problems were confusing. I think the order of these two problems should have been switched for it to flow better. Additionally, i think the most useful thing i learned was how to calculated the item-item similarity. This was useful because it helped me truly understand how to execute that algorithm
