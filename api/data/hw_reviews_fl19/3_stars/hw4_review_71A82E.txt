I do like this homework becasue it is quite practicle and useful. Step by step operations are useful when lerning new things. However, what I dislike it the orginizaiton of lecture slides. They are in bad sequence and some of them have the topic but more detialed things are in other slide, which makes me spend more time finding the content then actually reading the notes. I would perefer some hyper link to other ppt if the mentioned contents are omited.
