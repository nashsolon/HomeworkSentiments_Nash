I really enjoyed learning about Bonferroni's principle. It was a different way of conveying the idea that we have to be careful with data analytics becuase rare events become frequent in large data sets. I also really enjoyed analyzing the properties of the different data sets. I have been doing a lot of math and coding since starting down the data sciencey path and have not had a lot of time to think about 'real' setups and formulations in a concrete way like that. I was not crazy about the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data Questions.I think they were good questions but thought the answers were a bit hard to glean from the article. Overall I enjoyed the assignment.
