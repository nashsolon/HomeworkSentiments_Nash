What is the worst thing you may experience, is that, after you stay up for 4 days to 3 am, you finally made your proposal draft after a large delay, then finding you have a presentation, an experiment, a demo, a talk not finished and a homework that cannot be delayed anymore. Then while you were writing the homework, your advisor blamed you of the delay and bad writing, your committee were waiting for the draft, your presentation had only 12 hr left while you have not practiced, experiment is going to come to the time point, and collaborator blamed you why the demo is so late. I thought about throwing the homework blank many times. Life is like Sisyphus pushing the rock, a day ease means you have to push for two days.
