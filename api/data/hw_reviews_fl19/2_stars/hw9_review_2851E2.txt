The thing I liked most about this assignment was the majority of question 2. Actually going through all the transforms and obtaining different bits of information from the data was a good exercise and I found it intersting. The part I disliked most, however, was the part of question 2 where we were asked to draw the DAG. I feel that there were not enough examples of this in the notes, and the instructions were very unclear. I feel like the most important thing I learned was hoq persistence and pipelining works when dealing with RDDs in spark. This really helped me understand how spark works on a deeper level and I feel it will help a lot with completing my final project.
