This homework assignment was very frustrating. The instructions were extremely confusing and I quite literally spent hours either trying to decipher what was needed, being confused and not certain as to what was needed, or just doing the wrong stuff and having to redo my work. Even with the deadline, I was unable to truly finish and I feel comprehend as well as the other labs. I really did not like this assignment at all and it should be radically changed for next semester / next year. I think the surprising / hard thing was the level of flexibility needed for this assignment especially with the partitioner file reading and the many ways to actually implement without a standardized way that the TA's could know and be prepared to answer questions on that one format. I went to TA hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday trying to finish it, and I still do not think I did too well on it. We either needed more time or we needed a more reasonable assignment to complete.
