I disliked this assignment both due to its length and content. Regarding its length, this assignment had too many questions that required too much work each. But, much of my issue with the length of the assignment stems from the content within it. This section of material on SPARK was not taught very effectively so that I felt extremely unprepared to complete the coding portions of the homework (essentially most of the homework). The assignment was somewhat successful in helping me better understand how to work with RDDs, but I wish the material was taught more effectively with a greater focus on practical implementation and coding.If I could start over again I would teach myself SPARK as the slides, lectures, and lab section was largely unhelpful.
