I did not really like the first question much. I felt that it was really long and rather redundant. Basically, the main idea is that Hadoop is for big data. It kept asking for disadavantages that were not listed in Hadoop the Definitive Guide. I felt like I was digging in my pockets to not sound redunant. It seems like it was ll around that idea and could have been a shorter question. However, I did enjoy the MapReduce problems. I like when we are actually doing what the computer does behind the scenes. It is good to understand what the code is doing and not just writing it. Makes for better programmers.
