Doing this homework was very valuable in the sense that we were finally able to write our own Job1 and Job2 Mappers and Reducers. Even though it was a homework that I learned a lot from, I did not particularily enjoy this homework that much. There was way too much information that the lecture slides did not do a good job of explaining. I found myself spending hours doing research on looking for material to understand the concepts rather than applying what I should have learned in class to the homework assignments. This homework was also very long and asked a lot of questions. Overall, didn't really like this homework compared to previous homeworks.
