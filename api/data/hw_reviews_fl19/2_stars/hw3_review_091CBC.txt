I didn't fairly enjoy this homework because there was too much reading that was nonexistent in the provided materials. I had to google a lot and most of the information provided on the hadoop website was obscure and difficult to understand.The questions seemed to be too open ended and it was hard to pinpoint just exactly what is being asked. I was surprised by how ambiguous this homework was. I learned about the different daemons of YARN and what it does in MapReduce. I also learned about what skew meant in MapReduce.
