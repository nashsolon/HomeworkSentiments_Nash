I think that homework 3 was too challenging, and that YARN is not a concept that we actually need to understand in order to be good at using Hadoop. I realize it's always good to know how things work behind the scenes but I don't think that this particular problem set was a good way to test our knowledge on it. Perhaps something like "expain in your own words what YARN does" would have been better or more appropriate.
