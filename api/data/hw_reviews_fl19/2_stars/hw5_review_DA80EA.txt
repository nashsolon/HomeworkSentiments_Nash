I found this lab extremely challenging. I forgot to change the input file format, so it took me a really long time to work out the lab. I found the material, however, very interesting as I see the application it has to companies like Spotify Amazon and more. Going forward, I want to see how updating thse reccomendations actually happen (i.e. how do they constantly update it) and how can you understand how to deal with the sparseness of the data.
