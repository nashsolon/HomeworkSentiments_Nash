This is probably the second to worst homework after homework 1. The first problem was fine as was most of problem 2. The graph for two was challenging since we have not made them ourselves in class, so it was hard to know what Neuman wanted. Problem 3 was annoying since the definition for "result" is super unclear, and the result is never really stored unless you specifically ask Spark to store it, so the question doesn't really make sense. Question 4 was plain awful. If you ask for which format is more efficient, you need to more clearly define each format as well as your basis for efficiency.
