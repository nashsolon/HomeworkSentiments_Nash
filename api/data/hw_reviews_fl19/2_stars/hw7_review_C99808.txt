This homework was quite frustrating but I learned a lot. The top N was quite challenging. I had a bug in my buffer reader that caused much headache. I was surprised at how some of the movies were rated highly because I didn't think they would. I liked how this homework was a mix of coding and conceptual questions. The communication costs were much greaterthan I expected. I would have started the coding much earlier, If I could redo the homework. I kept testing on the Whole TrainingRatings and should have tested only on the smaller file. I learned alot about combiners and how reducers and combiners can be interchangeable given the 2 conditions.
