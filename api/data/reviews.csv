0,fl18,hw2,AF72BBZ,"This assignment is a chance to review what i learned in class. Also, I can learn something new by doing this assignment. But there are some material weren't covered in class, I spent much time to search these marterial online. It gave me a hard time on it. The lucky thing is that I worked with my teammate, we both can share thoughts. It reduces time on thinking the problme.
",1
1,fl18,hw4,1B3313Z,"I think this assignment is much harder than the previous ones because it requires the real understanding of the MR program with secondary sort knowledge. I am very sad that we could not complete the assignment. We started it late and didn’t have time to finish. Really regret about how we perform. Hope we can do better next time
",1
2,fl18,hw4,AF72BBZ,"I continues to struggle with basic concept about HDFS level. This assignment is giving me a diffcult time in certain areas of HDFS. Areas in need of extra work are MapReduce. Working on these problme areas every week would help me improve my learning outcomes. Also, the coding part of this assignment is not easy too. Ispent much time on find some method about java using. The code for part two is harder than the code for part one in my opinion.
",1
3,fl18,hw4,B68C78Z,"This time the homework is totally different from what we did before. In the lab, we write some simple codes to use hadoop finishing some jobs. And then in the homework, we will need to use the similar way to finish some harder but more realistic job. This home work makes me realize what cloud computing is about in real world because before I only had some concepts about it. But as it is our first time using hadoop to process out own code, I have met many troubles and wasted a lot of time.
",1
4,fl18,hw4,B8F758Z,"Homework 4 is the most time consuming and the most difficult homework so far. Because it ask the students to implement mapreduce jobs and add parameters and write code to assign reducers at the same time without enough guids. Also, many java knowledge required in this assignment is not covered in class nor in labs. We spent the whole day to finish this assignment.
",1
5,fl18,hw4,DD61E5Z,"I did not like this homework. I thought the directions were very unclear. Part (a) for Problem 1 was confusing because 
it seemed like the mapper and reducer input/output could be found within the job. The question should have told us to 
determine the input/output by hand explicitly. Part b and c is confusing because I didn't know what I was comparing the job 
execution to. Was a comparing it to the job in the previous part or was I comparing the job before the implementation of the current part?
Question 2 part d was a similar repeat of another problem on a previous homework that hadn't been graded by the time this one was due. Overall
I would rate this homework a 1 star out of 5 because it was by far the worst homework this far. 
",1
6,fl18,hw4,DD781FZ,"In my opinion, hw4 is the hardest homework so far. Firstly, setting up eclipse and learning how to run the code took lots of time. Then, since hadoop did lots of work (i.e., group, sort) automatically and the question provides part of codes, it is hard to debug our code since we were not one hundred percent clear everything that was going on. Finally, running a Shakespeare test case took almost half an hour on our computer since we do not have a computer with large memory.
",1
7,fl18,hw5,1B3313Z,"I think this assignment becomes even more challenging than the previous ones. It requires complete understanding of the mapreduce and its tools. For example, the partitioner. I am glad that through this assignment I got familiar with all the useful aspects of mapreduce. It was very exciting and hard that I learn a lot from it
",1
8,fl18,hw5,942FB2Z,"HW5 was hard, not necessarily in the sense that the execution/answering is hard, but more in terms of understanding the question. Many times I simply did not understand what the question was asking for, particularly 2a. I understand the terms listed in the problem but honestly failed to understand the connection. Also the inconsistencies between the homework instructions and the actual path or state of files, although easy to mediate after a clarification was given, was frustrating and confusing.
",1
9,fl18,hw5,AF72BBZ,"This assignment is harder compared to previous assignments. In HW5, it's required more skills on java code. Personally, I like coding part because it easier for me. For question 1, the most hardest thing is about regex. For question 2, the most hardest thing is about sort. For question 3, I finshed with my teammate, he was good at solving such problme. Anyway, regex and java code skills are needed in order to finish this assignment. And as I menthioned, this one is harder compared to previous assignments.
",1
10,fl18,hw5,DD61E5Z,"The first question was extrememly easy and did not teach students anything new. It was only 
busy work. The questions ask to provide your own comments but its really pointless because the 
files already have adequate comments in there. Some new comments could be written but students 
shouldn't be penalized for keeping some of the default comments if they make sense or describe
the methods correctly.

Question 1 also had a type and told students to look at the wrong files for submission. This was
very confusing and should be fixed. Question 2 also had some quirks. We never talked in class 
what key distributions were and TAs never logged into Piazza to answer this question. 

Question 3 was poorly written and the files needed to run this correctly were not specified well 
in the assignment. 

Because of the issues in this homework, I would rate it a 1 out of 5 stars.
",1
11,fl18,hw6,1B3313Z," feel really bad about this assignment. And really really bad. I feel really bad about this assignment because everything went down in the worst way. Things did not work out. Things did not work out. Things did not work out. I could not think of why. This is awful. Very much depressing 
",1
12,fl18,hw6,AF72BBZ,"This assignment is the hardest one uitl now. Some methods wasn't even covered in class. And it's stupid to compare two methods one with combiner antoher without. Professor metioned that we are not allowed to put data into hadoop. So how could we run it in hadoop. Also, you only teach us how upload a folder instead of a txt file. This assignment makes me painful and worthless to me.
",1
13,fl18,hw6,B8F758Z,"This home work is very confusing. The sample code shared with us on the guidance is slightly different from our project. Thus we need to get clear of every step of implementing the 2 programs.It include many different data types in 2 jobs' mapper program and reducer program. Thus the eclipes alwasy throws pout errors caused by data tye misuse.We spent longer time than previous weeks on this week's homewors.
",1
14,fl18,hw7,95A139Z,"I thought this assignment was kind of annyoing. The proof was really dull and not very clear so it was not enjoyable. The other problem was going through the whole cosine difference equation was interesting but somewhat tedious. In general while it was an interesting topic the overall assigment was dull. Pig will be an improvement.
",1
15,fl18,hw8,0D3DD8Z,"this homework was very frustrating and rewarding at the same time. I used the local sample set in order to test and debug my code, but I wasn't able to confirm if it was correct or not. So, a lot of debugging had to be done with the entire dataset, which took a very long time and made the whole homework very frustrating. Although I felt like I learned more about PIG, it really reassured me that I don't want to use it ever again. 
",1
16,fl18,hw8,720CA7Z,"I am really frustrated while I was doing homework 8. There are so many problems! And I have to google every obstacle which took a long time. And for problem 4, I had to wait until lab 8 is finished to do that. In conclusion, I don't like the homework 8
",1
17,fl18,hw8,96B3B0Z,"this homework assignment was very difficult because I got confused the pig terminal command and therefore none of my code ran for several hours. after solving this command, i felt that the homework assignment was not that bad. Overall the material was interesting and it made more sense and was more fluid than java.
",1
18,fl18,hw8,9CAEDDZ,"This was my least favorite homework so far, especially the problems that dealt with pig. These problems were very difficult, and the slides did not provide enough reference or examples to help with figuring out what to do. It would be very helpful if there was a section of the GROUP pig command and how it worked.
",1
19,fl18,hw8,A67BB6Z,"This homework was very challenging in that we had to thoroughly practice using Pig and Spark at the same time to analyze data. However, it provided me new insights on efficiently processing data using Pig and Spark. In the future, I hope that the two languages to be offered as separate homework assignments, to spend more time on each language.",1
20,fl18,hw8,AF72BBZ,"This assignment is much harder compared to previous assignments. Some materials wasn't covered in lecture and in lab like change the format of ouput, read data from xml, using fucntions and etc. Python skill is required for this class but students may dont have time to catch up in a short time. If student already has thoese skills, there is no meaningful reason to take this course since they can learn it by self. Also, spark and pig are differecult, you could divide it into two parts as two assignments. After students finished pig part problmes, they may no any effort to keeping do spark.
",1
21,fl18,hw8,B68C78Z,"There are 5 problems in homework 8 and I think this homework is hard because we have never used Spark or Pig to deal with data before. And I spent a lot of time doing some “set up” job and finally I get familiar with it. And in this process, I really felt bad and for many times I did not know what to do in the next step because I think the things we learned in class is not enough at all to finish the job so I have to Google for some functions and tried them time to time. I hope next time we could have enough information for us to finish homework..
",1
22,fl18,hw8,D8E4A3Z,"I think hw8 is the worst homework among all the given one. The instruction of the code is not clear enough and the ta is not helpfulat all. I waste a lot of time because of the unclear of the problem and the instructions. I think next year, ta should make the problem more clear. But, I do get something from this homework, but in total, it is a really bad one. 
",1
23,fl18,hw8,DE92B9Z,"This homework is really tough, there are tons of problems and we cannot find clear referation to those problems in lecture notes or lab instruction, neither the online sources, so parts of questions can only be answered based on our experience and understanding of the spark, i think it's might be better to move out the spark part since they are not totaly covered in our process, so much questions are unclear and cannot be answered confidently according to what we learned on class.
",1
24,fl18,hw8,EB9B51Z,"I did not enjoy this homework. I felt that we were not taught pig sufficiently well enough to write the code that we were asked to write. Other than that, I found this homework to be particularly difficult and I thought that many of the concepts and questions could have been clarified.
",1
25,fl18,hw9,48CF23Z,"This is the second time I work with other, and also the final homework. I felt tired when the project deadline passed. There are many problems that ask for an expansion, and it's hard to make sure that the answer is 100% correct. So before the homework's deadline, I have to check it once again and again, which is very tiring. What's more, I faced the problem of my dataset, which is also very time-consuming.",1
26,fl18,hw9,A29986Z,"This homework was awful. It was impossible to be able to check your answers and nobody answered any questions on piazza other than the useless “restart your vm” question when the scala wasn’t working. Having to spend so much time troubleshooting and asking questions about what questions actually mean rather than learning is so frustrating. Why do we have to give the same answers twice for 1b and 2a? 

 


",1
27,fl18,hw9,A67BB6Z,"This homework was the most difficult homework of all. Using flume to put the weblogs in HDFS could cause a lot of bug and not correctly produce a good result, and resulting operations with Spark could have produced faulty results. Also, it was not clear on how to efficiently join RDDs. Finally, the PageRank efficiency was very confusing and I could not find a definite answer from the slides.",1
28,fl18,hw9,B68C78Z,"This time I think the homework is very hard. Not only because it requires us to run different kinds of codes in different places(I only think it's hard but it's useful), It also has some problems that are not related to our class. For example, there is a problem in the file given to us to run, but we should comment some code out or we can not run that file. And there are also problems about memory of svn. I think it's too hard for me to handle all these additional problems in one homework.
",1
29,fl18,hw9,E8D048Z,"I have to say hw9 is a pretty bad homework. There's no example for all 4 problems, especially the first one, we spent bunch of time figuring it because there was no even one example we can refer to. Also the second and thrid problems. The amount of time we worked on it was around 12 hours. I would rate very bad on this week's homework. Really request any example we can refer to.",1
30,fl18,hwM,95A139Z,"I personally really disliked this assignment. Not only was it boring, the instructions were unclear or ambiguous. On the occasion where the instructions were clear there was likely to be an issue with the data not being where they stated it was. On two occasions did we have to use random posts on piazza to solve major issues about missing data or missing system settings that had set us back way to long. Overall I was displeased with this assignment.
",1
31,fl18,hwM,96B3B0Z,"No lie, this homework was terrible. My partner and I had such a hard time with it because there was an overaching lack of directions. To elaborate, in question 3, the instructions say that the data was in hadoop, but it wasn't so my partner and i had to go digging for hours to find the data. In addition, question 2, my yarn resource manager didn't show the stats neccesary so i struggled for hours to find how to show it.
",1
32,fl18,hwM,A912DBZ,"hmW takes longer time to prepare the work rather than doing the work which make it really boring and annoying. Second question takes long time to execute and the third one lack of instructions where are part of the data locates. Overall, this homework's design is not good enough.
",1
33,fl18,hwM,AF72BBZ,"This assignment is hard. If professor wants to give us some free bouns for extra assignment, please dont be mean. The page rank part is the same level to final project. This assignment requires students to finish all questions by using spark, python and pig. This is final term, and there is no much time to focus on this single assignment, Please, be nice! If you want to us some extra points. Not only because runing pig scripts is really slow, even in local job runner mode, it's also not flexible. For instance, I cannot filter out customers with orders less than 5 while I am doing the counting. At least I don't know how to do it. It is also really hard to debug the program since I cannot set break points.  

",1
34,fl18,hwM,DD781FZ,"This hw is one of the most stressful hw among all 10 hw assignments. Problem 1 is fine for my group. But problem 2 took way too long to just compute the results. We took around three hours to get the result. Problem 3 was provided most codes so it was fine as well.
",1
35,fl18,hwM,DE92B9Z,"this homework doesn't make sense, althought it covers the materials we were taughted during class, that cannot support us to do this homework, also, it's really annoyed that the instruction got certain mistakes or unreasonable implemention as it would leads students to a totally wrong way and cost us tons of time to confused about where we made wrong and how to fix it, and finally we found it's the wrong in the instruction or something unclear caused it, this is really worthless and inefficient, hoping professor can double check the instruction in next semester to avoid it happen again since it definitelly harm the motivation of students to do the homework and learn something correctly.
",1
36,fl18,hwM,E8D048Z,"The amount of this week's homework are pretty heavy, covering the last 2 weeks topic: pig and sparks. Really hope the homework can be less and easier. Problems 1~3, pig coding is really the new field that we've never touched before. Problem 4, the spark one, took a great amount of time to deal with since all commands has to be discovered through the API docs by lots of readings. It took us around 8 hours to finish. Don't like it.",1
37,fl18,hw1,26044FZ,"I think hw1 is a qualified test but not a good one.

The first question is about the characteristic of Big Data. It deepens my understanding about the characteristic of Big Data. The second question is about Bonferroni’s Principle. It uses Bonferroni's Principle to tell us what we mine in the Big Data could be random. The third question is about read an academic article. It improves my academic reading.

But all of these questions are a little not practical and are just close to the theroy. Maybe there should be some practical programming questions. I know this is our first homework, so it can not be much programming tasks. But if there is a task that we need to open a data file to see data and really feel what is Big data in virtual machine closely, it will be better.
",2
38,fl18,hw1,268B8EZ,".This homework helped me to understand and review some details about big data. Without this, I can hardly remember all of them just by class. And I find the second question really interesting, it changed the way to compute the number, and I think this is really creative and helpful!For the third question, I found it pretty hard to read the whole essay and extract the main idea to summarize it, so I need to spend more time to improve my reading skill.",2
39,fl18,hw1,AF72BBZ,"I worked this assignment with a teamamte. By doing this assignment, we review the concept which mentioned in class. In addition, we also shared different thoughts on the same question. It's a good chance to learn more about the concept by taking to each other. It covers the basic concept and something new. However, the reading part is very hard and it's not related to our lecture. We spent much time on understanding the meaning behind the article. For students  whose native language is not english, they feel painful.  
",2
40,fl18,hw1,BF0535Z,The first homework is rather trivial because half of the homework is to chracteristirize the dataset described. It is poorly designed as well. Asking question about an article but changing the norm with similar words can cause a lot of confusion epecially when the concepts are new. ,2
41,fl18,hw1,F6ADB8Z,This homework basically gives me an impression of boring. Problem 1 is applying the definition we learned on course to evaluating several kinds of data. Problem 2 is a bit more interesting. But what we actually need to do is do the math exactly like the book did and come up with the right formula. Problem 3 is the least one I like. It brings me back to the days I prepared for GRE reading test. ,2
42,fl18,hw2,0B219FZ,"1. I think Homework II is easier than Homework 1 because there is not any math / probability in it. Maybe I'm just not good at Probability (it is fun though).
2. The instructor should cover the logic of MapReduce more thoroughly. We didn't do that last time due to time limit, but this is really important because it is the core of Hadoop / MapReduce.
",2
43,fl18,hw2,7B87F0Z,"I'm very disappointed with the the teaching staff's handling of the teaching staff on this homework assignment. Multiple questions have gone unanswered in the days leading up the auxiliary due-date. Many students had to put off this homework assignment last week due to career fair activities, and, unfortunately, they are not receiving the help they trying to get.
",2
44,fl18,hw2,BF0535Z,"I think homework two is good overall. It helps me go over the lab 1 again and has some reinforcement learning about the basic hadoop command lines and some options. Though I think there should be more help on the command line details because when I go to hadoop documentation for cat options there is no explanation or list for possible combinations of pipes. Other than that, I think the homework is help and helps me getting familar with the hadoop system.",2
45,fl18,hw3,942FB2Z,"I found HW3 more difficult than the previous homeworks, but it, like the previous homeworks, made me really think about the structure. The execution of MapReduce problem was really nice as I was led into executing the tasks and finding the outputs step by step and not looking everywhere to find out what I am supposed to be doing. I wasn't sure how much detail to put into number 3 and how much it was asking for.
",2
46,fl18,hw3,B8F758Z,"This homework HW3 is much harder than previous 2 homeworks, for the reason that it requires many detailed knowledges and asks us to summarize the whole process of many complex progress. Some of the questions is very tricky and we need to review the slides and the book to figure out the right answer. In general, this homewrk took longer time than homework one and homework two.
",2
47,fl18,hw3,BE38FEZ,"The homework 3 is difficult for me and my parterner. We always feel confused about the meaning of the questions. So we often spend a lot of time on figuring out the correct meaning of it. Also, the top of this homework is also a little bit hard.

I would say I'm definitely okay with that kinda of home, though I would prefer more hands on experience. For example like actually doing coding and submit it to run the hadoop and see the status update from the datanodes stuff like that.",2
49,fl18,hw3,D8E4A3Z,"I think home work 3 is a fair homework. It is far more better than home 1. Actually, I think no home work will worse than homework 1. But compared to homework 1, it is still not that good. The question a of question one is quite troublesoem, we need to use a lot of times to press the down button to find the correct answer. Question 2 is a goog question, I think. As to question 3, I think it is the same as question 3 of homework 1. The question is a little unclear. We can answer a lot of things in this question, but we can not make sure which one can get the point. ",2
50,fl18,hw3,F9581AZ,"The first assignments are graded and we weren’t doing great. That’s a bummer. So we are kind of upset and panicked. I wasn’t motivated to start on homework3 at all. It took me 3 days to finish half of the questions and I felt guilty for not being as efficient as my partner. We reviewed the questions closely, validated and discussed with each other. I’m going to review them again before submission so I think it might be good?",2
51,fl18,hw3,FFBEA4Z,"This homework was neither my favorite, nor my least favorite of the assignments.  While running a mapReduce job is interesting and dealing with the output is important, I found that the class explanation of YARN and textbook readings were insufficient in terms of my greater understanding.  I found the YARN question difficult to answer and found it hard to figure out what was even being asked.  I also found the skew question confusing.
",2
52,fl18,hw4,0D3DD8Z,"This homework was pretty straightforward however it was hard to spot errors at times because all of the information/slides we were pulling from were in many different places. The biggest difficulty I found was trying to understand why I couldn’t get 3 MapReduce tasks to run instead of one for Problem 2. Also, a lot of the instructions were unclear, which made it difficult to finish/debug.
",2
53,fl18,hw4,13F585Z,"Homework 4 was a struggle for multiple reasons. First of all, I did not allocate enough time to finish the assignment (spent about ~4 hours working on this). I got my problem #1 working in eclipse but not via hadoop, so I couldn't really answer questions b-f. The second part was reliant on the first, so I didn't finish that either.

Rating: 2/5
",2
54,fl18,hw4,18EC32Z,"I thought that this homework was much more challenging than the previous homeworks. This is mostly because we had to write custom classes that we have not had much exposure to before.

55,fl18,hw4,7B87F0Z,"Rating: 2

I had a job interview last week which made me start the homework much later than I would have liked. This caused a lot of undue stress combined with the fact that that I had to restart my VM from scratch. I still like the material and found implementing the toolrunner very interesting.
",2
56,fl18,hw4,8B9689Z,"This homework was a lot more loaded in terms of material and was worded very poorly. This made it harder to follow and finish on time. Question 1 was confusing because it wasn’t clear as to what was expected of us. It would have been better if the instructions were clear or if TAs were a little responsive on Piazza. This homework did teach us how to use ToolRunner and Partitioner with our projects which I am happy about. Other than that, this homework made me frustrated. ",2
57,fl18,hw4,96B3B0Z,"I thought this assignment was hella difficult. Only because I get really stuck on how to pull the file from distributed cache. Other than that I thought that it wasn't that bad.

58,fl18,hw4,A912DBZ,"the running of this homework is nasty. There can be potential problem with eclipse that it does not recognize the package imformation from the setup. Even with reinstalling the workspace from the scripts in the package. It does not recognize the project  properly. Probably changing to a more robust ide or using text editor is a better option than eclipse.
",2
59,fl18,hw4,B4AD6DZ,"This week’s homework is a lot more difficult than those in previous week. The question are more complicated and the wordings are so strange it is difficult to follow along; partially because the slides are hard to understand too. The homework is so much more time consuming because of the coding section now.
",2
60,fl18,hw4,CD4772Z,"this homework was so much more difficult and time-consuming than all the previous homework because of the code part of the homework. I like the fact that there is less writing in this homework compared to the other ones, but debugging the coding assignment part was extremely time-consuming, especially when I'm not very proficient in Java. It took me 2 hours to figure out how to test using the SentimentPartionTest java file to test my code because I am not familiar with Eclipse. Additionally, it also took a while for me to figure out how to read lines from a text file, after doing a lot of research on StackOverflow.
",2
61,fl18,hw4,DE92B9Z,"this homework is huge hard for us, the code execution mentioned in class is not detailed enough, so we have to learn how to implement them and review bunch of papers and articles. Also, maybe professor should emphaisze the important concepts and code on class would be better for us to do homework, since we find there did have the explanation about the concept and code on note but i totally has not remember professor has mentioned them on class. Anyway, this is a tough homework and we spent lots of time on it.

62,fl18,hw4,E8D048Z,"This homework is extremely hard. Especially the second question. There's no file and code we can take as reference so it's sooo time-wasted and energy consuming.

I did not finish my lab, so I went into the homework blind. I found myself stuck on a problem so I searched internet all day for it and counln't find an answer.

The code implement is not that hard but it asks many theoratical questions, which is very difficult to state it clearly.

It first appears to me very hard becasue we need to create our own top-n list's Mapper and Reducer, which is essentially lab5.

106,fl18,hw1,25795FZ,"*********review of HW1*************

The workload of homework 1 is reasonable. And I think it contains various types of problems, including reading, concepts and some math problems, which is good. Problem 1 is good enough and helps understand concepts of defining big-data. Some contents from the questions have ambiguous boundaries, and hopefully they don’t have strict answers. For problem 2 is brief and perfect. And it is nice to have a table to test out the solution. For problem 3, the article is well-written with the topic of speech recognition and machine translation. It is generally good. However, although given the opportunity of understanding data-mining notions through this specific topic, it may not be the easiest example for getting a grasp of these concepts appeared in this problem. For example, when I tried to look at the paper with specific questions in mind or tried to search the key word “data-based”, it is hard to find the information I need. So overall, I will rate the homework 1 as 4 stars out of 5.

I found the article that we read for Part 3 as a very good read but was disappointed by the questions as they seemed to be a bit ambiguous.

It was fun but have some issue that was really hard to solve that took me so long until a TA answered my question. The question 2 and 3 are very difficult to do because to be honest the lecture still left me full of question on these stuff, but that’s probably because I  never took a matrix class before.
",3
211,fl18,hw7,B8F758Z,"Homework 7 is relatively easy compare to previous HomeWorks. However, it took us some time to figure out the code for problem one. In addition, the calculation of cosine similarity between item and item in problem 3 is a little tricky, As the way of calculate similarity measure listed in the slides is different from the calculation listed in the book. 
",3
212,fl18,hw7,BE38FEZ,"In this assignment, we gained a deeper understanding in the MapReduce program. Also, according to compare different similarity measures, we learned their advantages and disadvantages. Using an appropriate similarity measure can help us do a better job in collaborative filtering to address recommendation problem. I have learned a lot from this assignment.

213,fl18,hw7,BF0535Z,"The assignment is okay. I just teamed up with a class mate so the homework is pretty chill as I'm not doing 100% work myself.

214,fl18,hw7,D2B1D1Z,"This homwork is has much difference with previous ones. Comparing with other homeworks, it focus more on mathmatics. Doing mathmatical computation by hand is kind of annoying. It is complex to write down the output and inputs step by step. But I have to admit that it is helpful. Computation by hand can help us make a deep understanding of the principle of algorithm. So I think this homework is not too bad.
",3
215,fl18,hw7,DD781FZ,"Compare to previous hw, this one requires more calculation (especially on problem 2 and 3). This is fine to me. Most of the explanation questions were covered in lecture. The first question was about lab materials and the questions were a little ambiguous to me. I think first question is the hardest among the three problems in this hw.This homework in general is easier than previous one. The first problem is able to complete when follow the lab instruction. The only challenge is that we need to write the whole driver, mapper and reducer class, which we never did before. The second problem is not hard to solve, but some explanation requires careful thought.

The first problem is quite easy, I borrowed the reuder and stringpairwritable from the word_co_writable. for the rest peoblem, besides by looking the slides which provided by the professor, I also did some research on google. I learned a lot.
The problem 3 took me some time, I'm glad that I figured it out, at least I think

219,fl18,hw8,155C20Z,"This is my eighth homework. It is mainly about pig and spark. It helps me get familiar with the schema and syntax of pig and spark. Problem 3 is a bit tricky, because I am not sure what the denominator of the ctr is, all the records or the total number of websites? Additionally, concerning the spark, I cannot really find the syntax reference from the slide. In all, I will rate this homework a 3 stars.

220,fl18,hw8,1BA8DEZ,"This homework is kind of tedious. I spend a lot of time on the homework, not because it is difficult, but because its requirement is very long and I have to go through many steps to try to figure out the right answer.

I had no idea that the functions needed were provided in the hw folder ant it took like an hour to figure out. A nice note in the homework would have been helpful. Other than that I think I learned a lot.,3
222,fl18,hw8,A0208DZ,"this homework is really helpful to me. in this homework I used pig to manipulate and analyze data output from hadoop. also i used spark to analyzed data. these are useful in practical problems. also by doing the last problem, i learnt how pipelining works in spark. This is a practical homework.

223,fl18,hw8,A2D4B6Z,"This homework was a really good way to test and build on our Pig and Spark knowledge without making it too tricky. However we definitely struggled at times to get the correct output. Debugging was a challange at times as well because the output usually look around 7-8 minutes to actually print and with many bugs to check and fix it look a long time to fix small amounts of code.

224,fl18,hw8,B7035CZ,"This homework helps mew review the pig etl, and I did filtering, grouping and sorting in this homework. The speed is ok when running locally; however,when I run it on the hadoop it takes too much time to execute. Overall, I feeel ok with this homework. It's not hard, but just takes a lot of time on it. 
",3
225,fl18,hw8,B8F758Z,"The homework 8 is relatively easy than previous ones. However, it is still very time consuming as it contains 5 questions. Among the five questions, problem 5 is very easy. However, question 4 is a little bit confusing and took us some time to figure out the right syntax and the proper transformation operation to use to solve the problem, because some of the practice have not been covered in course materials including slides and lab instructions. Thus, we need to look up the spark guide.
",3
226,fl18,hw8,D2B1D1Z,"In my opinion, this homework is kind of boring. The last two problems about Spark are hard and helpless. Although most knowledge is covered by the slides, few of slides can be take as reference as more examples are needed. Without the examples, it is hard for me to have a deep understanding of Sparks. So I had a hard time to work with this homework.

227,fl18,hw8,DD781FZ,"hw8 has more problems then previous and it requires more time. Problem 5 is the easiest. Problem 1 requires lab 7 exercise. On my own opinion, problem 1, 3 and 4 are harder than 2. They also require some knowledge on Pig / Spark that other than we learned in lecture class. 
",3
228,fl18,hw8,DF80ADZ,"this homework is very, very interesting. To be honest, this is my first time contact pig and spark, it took me some time to figure it out. I really like this process. To see how simple code to change thecontent of the file to what we want. 
about the pyspark, thanks for the three functions provided by professor. otherwise i really don't know how to do it.
And about the pig, at first I'm a litte confused about the pig filename and pig -x local filename. So error comes a lot. I'm glad finally I solved it and I should be more careful.

Problems 1~3, pig coding is really the new field that we've never touched before. Problem 4, the spark one, took a great amount of time to deal with since all commands has to be discovered through the API docs by lots of readings. It took us around 8 hours to finish. Don't like it.",3

Mostly confused at first, then took a detour through course materials and google, with someone else's help i finally arrive at some conclusion. BBut i'm still unsure about whether im on the right track or not. I hope I can survive this class. I panic everytime I do the homework and things haven't changed since homework 3 or 4. Sorry but I don't think I'm the biggest fan of the homeworks. I suck...
",3
232,fl18,hw8,FFBEA4Z,"This homework was overall pretty good, but I thought that it was too long.  I like that it was largely implementation based, because I can reason about these questions on my own with some help from the ta's.  I thought this homework did not need to be 5 questions long, because each question, besides question 5, was pretty involved.  Also, I found it strange that spark was on this homework, even though the lab that corresponded to the homework was the pig lab.  This means that I had to answer questions about spark without having used it (except for a couple days before the homework was due).  Doing the labs helps my conceptual understand, so I don't like when there are questions for which the material was only covered in lecture.
",3
233,fl18,hw9,0CE6FFZ,"homework 9 is not mediocre from my perspective. although question 1 is a good refresh of the materials covered during the lecture and lab, question 2 is a little bit tedious. for example, part a is a redundant question. for part e, i think it was trying to ask us to join part b with part c, and I was confused at first. also part e didn't mention that we need to create a python file instead of using spark shell, so I've wasted a lot of time debugging and i was upset. question 3 and 4 are not bad. overall i rate this homework mediocre.

234,fl18,hw9,1EBAB4Z,"This homework helped me understand how to transform data using sparks and get the values I want from a log file. It is a very practical problem that can come up in the real world. It also helped me understand how to load values from relational database and how to process that data. I learned how joining two RDDs work. In addition it was helpful in understanding spark job execution and page ranks’s data representation.
",3
235,fl18,hw9,25795FZ,"Hw9 is mostly about spark jobs and a little of page-rank algorithm. So I think they are helpful in terms of understanding the rdd’s transformations and spark jobs. However there are two suggestions to make it even better. One is that the instruction of this time is not as precise as previous ones. For example, there are some warnings when following the set-ups. The other one would be that it would be better if we had one homework that gives us a good understanding of the overall workflow of a real-life-like task.

At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 3 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 3 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 2 stars. In terms of clarity of instruction, I will give 3 stars.

238,fl18,hw9,6DEC67Z,"this week's homework was frustrating and confusing beyond belief. Spark is very finnicky, and has a lot of unknowns and specifics that weren't necessarily explained in the homework. A lot of the instructions were vague, and because the grading is a little subjective in this course, I feel uncertain if my solutions were correct, even if they returned the correct results. I'm worried that they would mark me off because I didn't do a more optimal or efficient solution.

Either way, I learned a lot about spark and it was useful. I do wish that there were clearer explanations about how everything worked in general though.

Also, spark and pig are differecult, you could divide it into two parts as two assignments. After students finished pig part problmes, they may no any effort to keeping do spark.It needs to show more appropriate behavior then interating with classmates.

Finally, the article that you recommended us to read related to big data, I found the data-based approach in it, known the limit of this approach and other example of “n-gram”.

(2) for problem 2, a little bit confused about the question. I have searched from google to help me understand what it want me to do. 

(3) too much reading, more learning of data, not bad

277,fl18,hw1,A3A0C4Z,"This homework assignment was a good introduction to identifying the qualities and characteristics of big data. By doing this homework assignment, I got a better understanding of what the aspects of a big data set are that make it unique, and potentially hard to deal with. It also helped me solve some basic problems regarding, and gain some intuition on the appropriate data structures to use when representing the features of a data set in a program. 

",4
278,fl18,hw1,A92B1AZ,"I thought that this homework wasn't that hard in terms of the diffculty of the individual questions. The time that it took was not too hard either because there was not one section that really sucked a lot of time. However, I did feel like the answers to some of these questions could be construed as a bit subjective because some of it could rely on people's interpretation of certain questions. I am looking forward to homework's were there is more of a certainty when it comes to the answers.
",4
279,fl18,hw1,B2CEECZ,"From problem 1, I figured out the characteristics of big data, which help me fully understand every meaning of characteristic. Problem 2 just urges you to use equations carefully.  But I got to say the essay of problem 3 is a bit too long. However, it is also good for my reading skill.",4
280,fl18,hw1,B4AD6DZ,"Overall I enjoy this homework. The first question is a bit tedious and repetitive but it is a good review and practice for the stuff we leared in the first lecture. Although the wording on that question is a bit confusing at point(like the chemical compound one). The second question I had quite some fun with it because I quite like statistic stuff so yah overall the stuff makes sense once I read about it in the text book but to be honest text book was confusing too. The last question I didn't enjoy much because the reading was so long and confusing until I read it for the 3rd time. But it is good knowledge to know.
",4
281,fl18,hw1,B68C78Z,"There are 3 problems in homework 1 and I think the first one is very great because it requires me to use what I have learned in class and analyze them in depth. The second problem is also interesting and I can learn something from it. The last problem is very hard for me because it is not an easy task to understand the whole essay and I also spend much time figuring out what the questions mean and what are the corresponding answers.

",4
282,fl18,hw1,B7035CZ,"The first part of this homework tests the contents in the lecture 1, about characteristics of big data, such as amount, size, infinity. I learnt that wikipipedia has millions of English articles and learnt about ZINC database. 

The second part is a probability problem that tests the number of cases of evil-doers in a random case. From that I learnt the large number of ""evil"" cases even
if there is no evil-doer.

The third part is a scientific paper that supports unlabeled big data in language recognization.

This homework lets me get deeper ideas into big data, but I also feel it's kind of conceptual and abstract. I expect more coding and practical problem-solving work.
",4
283,fl18,hw1,B8F758Z,"Homework 1 is not difficult but kind of time consuming in the sense that it introduces many unfamiliar concepts in the reading material. And it takes time to get a comprehensive understanding of each concepts introduced in the article and summarize the ideals. Also, as many questions do not have only one correct answer, I’m not sure if I have included all points in the summarize.
",4
284,fl18,hw1,BF7834Z,"Totally good enough. 3 problems, one concept, one calculate and one read articleto answer some questions. From the homework, we can review what we learned from the class, familliar with the textbook and learn other knowledge. Only one thing, the description on the problems 1 is a little bit confused me. Maybe can be more clear.  
",4
285,fl18,hw1,C0915AZ,"After finishing this homework I feel good but also a little tired. Because I think I learned a lot from it, many great ideas and concept and useful knowledges. But also as a new student from another country the first homework took me quite a lot of time to finish especially the reading part. But still I think it’s a great article to read.
",4
286,fl18,hw1,C67B5DZ,"The homewrok relates to the knowledge introduced in class well, especially the first problem. But some other problems are not so organized. For example, when dealing with the second problem I figured out a result that is correct only with the first group of data(p=2,d=2). So I googled this question and found that this question is an example of Bonfon Lonnie principle. And I found that my result is just the same with that. So I am confused whether my answer is correct or not. And I think some more statements should be added at the end of this problem to tell us why we are doing such a culculation like ""analysis based on limited restrain is meaningless"" or so. Just my own perspective.
",4
287,fl18,hw1,CD4772Z,"Homework 1 was more qualitative than I expected. It wasn't too difficult and it was still quite time-consuming. Although I thought the homework was very helpful - it helped me understand the Bonferroni's Principle and characteristics of big datasets a lot better. Additionally, I thought the article was a little hard to comprehend but the questions did help force me to read it more carefully and I do understand the article better now.
",4
288,fl18,hw1,D8E4A3Z,"There are totally three question in this homework. I think the first and second question is straight forward. Especially the second question, it strength my understanding of that problem. However, I speand a lot of time on the third problem, not only reading the article, but finding the answer in the articel. Ithink that the question is not clear enough, especially question b and c. The article has talked about many problems based on data set and I am not sure which one to describe and talk about the problem. I think the question should be more clearin next homework. ",4
289,fl18,hw1,DD61E5Z,"I liked the first questions because I had to use knowledge that I learned in class. I did        
not like the 2nd question because we had never talked about probabilities in the class and there
were no	resources to help students to understand the question. The third question was okay since 
it required us to read an article where we could figure out the answer ourselves. Overall, I think
the homework was of standard difficulty	for being the first assignment. 
",4
290,fl18,hw1,DE92B9Z,"The HomeWork 1 is comprehensive and well designed, first question corresponding to the content of lecture 1 and help me strength the understanding of basic concepts and features of big data, although for certain characteristics i cannot give 100% ensure it's right like if the Wikipedia article is structured or semi-structred, so this makes me a little upset as there are no clear definition about which is structured that mentioned in class.
For question 2, it's well interesting and our groupd had a fun time to discuss and infer the final function, this is a good question although we think it's more likely a probability problem rather than big daya issue.
For question 3, the article is so long and professional that we totally had no idea when first browse it, the concept like Semantic Web is so new to us and we really put into a lot time to figure out what it means, also, the architacture of this article is a bit of confussed us and we cannot correspond its content with the question cleary, so like question 2 about the approach, what it refers to? the article has never clearly suggest a approach, so this really makes us upset. But after reading the article several times and search certain related info through Google to help us understanding, it tough us a lot of useful and fresh knowledge.
That's it. Thanks
",4
291,fl18,hw1,E20576Z,"The first homework is mainly a review of the things taught in the first week, I think it is a good way for us to review some knowledge and view some extra materials.
However, some questions in the hw actually I cannot find a good answer, such as the structure of the data. Also, the vmware is a troublesome thing for me at all. I spent a  lot of time on it and util now, it is still so uncomfortable for me. If we can complete our homework without it, it would be better for me.",4
292,fl18,hw1,E65908Z,"This assignment wasn't bad. The first question was kind of tedious and timee-consuming with having to explain everything. It was also a bit frustrating since a lot of the answers are up to interpretation. The second question was more fun. I had forgotten most of stats, but it was nice to refresh. The third question seemed more like busy work. The article was kind of interesting, but I don't think it was fully necessary to read the entire thing to understand the concept
",4
293,fl18,hw1,E8D048Z,"The first question directly relates to our lecture and what we discussed through the whole week. However, the second one seems difficult without enough tips and materials use for references. It took lots of time to figure out that formula. The third article is a good one except a little bit hard to summarize that approach since the content in that article is too much. I would say the first assignment is pretty fair. 
",4
294,fl18,hw1,F603FBZ,"I'm feeling a bit tired right now but I'm glad that I finished all the homework after all the craziness with A Capella recruitment. I guess I'm pretty excited finally go out tomorrow with Capri. We are going to go bowling and I haven't had a weekend for quite a while. Lab work is still busy, but the new team seems to be very productive and promising so I look forward to working with them. The homework was interesting and not too bad. Although reading the paper was a bit boring. 
",4
295,fl18,hw2,020E9BZ,"I gave this homework a number of 4. Overall, this homework requires a bit actual hands-on work, but most of the time I was writing short answer questions, which I don’t hate but short answer questions just don’t appeal to me. I would like to do more programming or anything that’s hands-on.",4
296,fl18,hw2,08BF6BZ,"The first question helps me understand how HDFS works better. I know the importance of block size and some more knowledge about storage.
I really like the 2nd problem and 3rd problem. These two questions offered me a more exact example about how that the map works and what the key and value should be. 
",4
297,fl18,hw2,0D3DD8Z,"I thought hw2 was pretty interesting. I do think that, like all the problems that reference the books, problem 1 was a bit boring. Although I learn more about the content, it just felt like unnecessary review because we already went over it during class. But, that's not to say that reviews don't help. 
I enjoyed problem 2 and 3 a lot because I was doing MapReduce by hand, and that made me think about the intire process a lot more than I would have if I was just using the computer to do it. 
",4
298,fl18,hw2,155C20Z,"This is my second homework of CSE427s. HW2 is generally about the structure of HDFS and procedures of a MapReduce program. And they are basic concepts of the course. Therefore, hw2 is not very hard, it questions multiple times which is time-consuming but very helpful to familiarize myself with the process of a MapReduce program. In all, I will rate 4 stars.

",4
299,fl18,hw2,1B3313Z,"This home work is very useful in helping us get an good understanding of HDFS and MR. I like it very much because I do. I have had a class like this for a while. Coding along with the understanding of concepts and many definitions really help me learn the topic well. I am very happy with this assignment
",4
300,fl18,hw2,254574Z,"This assignment was not as hard as I expected. It was fun sketching out the cluster and going through the MapReduce motions in our heads. Some of the advantage and disadvantage questions were too easily copy-pasted from the textbook though and while that makes life easy, is also not as fulfilling.
",4
301,fl18,hw2,25CAB2Z,"I enjoyed this homework because it pulled directly from our textbook reading and in-class work to apply the skill set towards a new problem. It was helpful to have textbook pages next to some problems and I felt confident that I could solve all the problems. The submission system is annoying.
",4
302,fl18,hw2,298071Z,"I gave this hw a rating of 4/5 stars - This homework was fine. I liked the last two problems but the first was a bit tedious with reading through the hadoop book as the questions were not all that clear. I think the drawing helped me understand the process better and the final two questions really helped me understanded the mapping and reducing in terms of what the computer actually does for you in between the two stages. Overall I think it really drew from lecture though and the slides which is helpul.

",4
303,fl18,hw2,48CF23Z,"Though the assignment is not very difficult, it's a little bit time-consuming, because I have spent a lot of time on problem one. I need to review the slide and textbook to make sure my answer is correct. However, problem 2 and 3 is quite easy. All I need is just to simulate the map reduce progress by hand.",4
304,fl18,hw2,52D3E3Z,"When doing this homework, I feel slightly more confident than doing the first one, because first of all I am more familiar with the process, such as how to set up my virtual machine, where to find textbook and help, and how to submit my homework. Also, I feel like this homework really helps me understand the materials from the concept level, not just the application level. 
",4
305,fl18,hw2,57AE00Z,"My favorite problems were parts 2 and 3. I liked that they gave me practice on manually computing the results of MapReduce. It helped me think about how the computer breaks the problem down. I enjoyed solving this homework a lot. For problem 1, I didn't like having to draw out all of the HDFS storage system. I found the question about the metadata confusing. ",4
306,fl18,hw2,6DEC67Z,"This homework was good; better than the last one. I got to solidfying my technical understanding of mapreduce without having to deal with the ambiguity of the last homework. It was good to figure out exactly how each input would be processed and stored. With large enough scale, I can understand how this process can be pretty powerful. In all, not too bad. Didn't take too long, either. Hooray!
",4
307,fl18,hw2,7086E1Z,"	The second homework is about HDFS and mapreduce. I am glad to say that by doing this homework, I learned more about cloud computing. And I like the difficulty of this homework, it allows us to solve the problem using the knowledge we learned from class or from reading the textbook.
",4
308,fl18,hw2,8254EFZ,"This homework was fairly easy. I hope all other assignments go as smooth as this. The only concern is that sketching the cluster state for an example HDFS was sort of a challenge. It would be nice to include some tips or instructions for easy creation of such diagrams and stuff. The hints that directed me to the textbooks were very helpful, I hope there are more tips coming similar these ones. 
",4
309,fl18,hw2,863B82Z,"I felt that questions two and three were fairly similar. It was not too difficult to answer each question, but there were some portions of question 1 that I felt were kind of vague. I felt that overall, questions two and three where good for getting a grasp of map reduce, but I think it would be beneficial to incorperate more hands on problems in the future.
",4
310,fl18,hw2,8D606DZ,"I prefer this homework than the previous one. It is more concrete and defined. And I feel the workload is about right. It does not consume too much time, but help us memory the commands and understand how map() and reduce() work. Especially I like it is paper-pencil, so that we don't need to write code.",4
311,fl18,hw2,95A139Z,"I really enjoyed this assignment. Thinking about HDFS and the way it works behind the scenes is a cool way to learn. This is also one of the few computer science classes I've been in that has purely written assignments which has been interesting. Its pretty cool and very different. Overall i found it to be pretty enjoyable. 
",4
312,fl18,hw2,A912DBZ,"in the first problem, for problem d, it will be great to have example problems so students can have reference or idea on how is the format will be. Problem 2 and 3 is good and give enough insight on how map and reduce works.",4
313,fl18,hw2,B4AD6DZ,"I feel like this homework is already starting to get more complicated than the first homework. I quite enjoy it though because I like the puzzle solving feeling from these questions, also the difficulty is not that high. I do not like some of the wording though. For example, problem 3, at first I was very confuse what does it mean by file type, like as in jpg or html, or the common/ catalog thing because they both make some sense.
",4
314,fl18,hw2,B8F758Z,"Homework 2 is slightly easier than the last homework. However, some of the questions in homework 2 are still very confusing and I do not know what exactly they are asking for and not sure if I have covered all the point in my answer. It would be very helpful if the questions can provide more detailed guide for the students. hw2 is slightly easier than the last homework. However, some of the questions in homework 2 are still very confusing. I would be very helful if the questions can provide more detailed guide for the students. 
",4
315,fl18,hw2,BE38FEZ,"This time I felt more familiar with the form of homework. I didn't came across many difficulties. For the first problem, to answer the questions properly, I read a lot of articles related to the HDFS and Hadoop. Even though, I still find that it's not enough. I still have a lot of things to figure out.
",4
316,fl18,hw2,C3C00CZ,"I liked this homework. Problem 1 had good questions that required some thinking about the HDFS, and problems 2 and 3 were great pen and pencil problems that made me think about the structure of the outputs, while still being simple and straightforward. I appreciated how we were asked to list the inputs and outputs of both the mapper and reducer seperately, because that made me think about how they are structured. ",4
317,fl18,hw2,CACBA2Z,"I enjoyed the second homework assignment as I thought we are starting to get into the meat of the material and actually being able to do stuff. This one was a bit more difficult as we had to diagram and think about the process of how a distributed file system works and we had to look at the benefits and negatives of both. I think everything that was done in this assignment was pretty beneficial towards learning the material of the class, but I do wish we had gone a bit further with the tasks.
",4
318,fl18,hw2,CD4772Z,"I thought homework 2 was a little better than homework 1 because the last 2 questions didn't require much writing but mostly just an understanding of how MapReduce works. I still don't like the questions that are more qualitative and require more reading (in this case question 1). Although it helps me reread the text, I found myself copying the words from the reading without completely understanding the concepts.
",4
319,fl18,hw2,D2B1D1Z,"In my opinion, homework 2 is much more difficult than the first one. But is more interesting either. It is hard to find answers for problem 1 in the text book. So I am not sure whether my answers are correct, which makes me anxious. Problem 2 and problem 3 are easier. The process of answering the questions was a good way to review the DFS. Drawing a sketch in Wrod is complex.
",4
320,fl18,hw2,D8E4A3Z,"I think homework 2 is better than homework 1 because the question is more clear. I know what the question is asking for and what I need to write. It also helps me to review the knowledge, which I think is a very helpful homework. Especially the question 1, I can get some hints in the book. This also remainds me of reading the text book. ",4
321,fl18,hw2,DE92B9Z,"homework 2 is more complex than homework 1 and we really spend a lot time on it.but it helpful for understanding and strengthen the knowledge of lecture and lab. however, certain questions are a bit of confused to understand clearly and precisely, which really waste times to figure it out.

",4
322,fl18,hw2,E20576Z,"this homework covers almost everything we learnt last week, help us review and dig more about the Hadoop Distributed File System.
But the question2 and question3 I think actually are the same thing, both about the input and output of the mapreduce process. I think it would be better if one of these 2 questions changes into some other questions.
Additionally, I would appreciate it if professor could put the image drawn in class into ppt.",4
323,fl18,hw2,E65908Z,"This homework was pretty painless. I didn't really enjoy the first problem, since it took a lot of reading and sometimes felt a bit unclear what exactly it was asking/looking for. The MapReduce problems were pretty simple. I'm not completely confident that I did them correctly, but if I did, then they definitely weren't super intensive. Really, this homework didn't take very long, especially compared to some other classes, so I really can't be mad about it.
",4
324,fl18,hw2,E8D048Z,"This homework is a good one. The second and third problem are highly related to lab2 and help us review the content of map reduce. And also the first question reviews the definition of HDFS. However, I personally think the (f) in question 1 is a bad one since there's no reference and resource about the process of how the data is located and transferred. I figured out by asking TA.
",4
325,fl18,hw2,F52E65Z,"I think this homework is pretty good, each problem helps me to better understand what I have learned in the class, but the Problem 1 isn't so good, because I didn't think that our teacher ever gave us a an example about what metadata looks like, this really bothers me about how to give an answer to that problem. The other problem is very nice.
",4
326,fl18,hw2,F6ADB8Z,"In my opinion, this homework is better than the last one. Problem 1 brings me deeper understanding about HDFS, how things are working and organized in it. Problem 2 and problem 3 are focusing on the MapReduce procedure. To be able to address these question, I have to be very familiar of each step in the algorithm. ",4
327,fl18,hw2,F9581AZ,"I was doing this homework with my partner in Duc. We were productive and efficient. I felt relaxed and motivated. We discussed and worked out the answers together quickly. I enjoyed it a lot. The weather was really nice too. Later we examined again, found some fallacies and fixed them. I feel pretty confident about this homework.",4
328,fl18,hw3,020E9BZ,"I think this homework has medium hardness so medium effort was put into it. On a side note I am glad that I found a partner so that we can do group submission on the homework, so I’m less frustrated by those short answer questions. Like last homework, I’d really prefer more coding instead.",4
329,fl18,hw3,0B219FZ,"1.	Homework 3 questions are relatively easy. Most of them are narration for the process, or can get the result directly from a file. No debugging is required.
2.	I have to re-do Lab3 for homework 3 because during the lab I deleted result files as instructed! Please review lab instruction and homework requirements so in the future they are ""compatible"".

",4
330,fl18,hw3,0D3DD8Z,"This homework was pretty fun. I liked that it used lab2's results to answer problem 1. It was really cool to see how much the words 'the' and 'love' were used in shakespeare's works. 2 and 3 were also pretty good because I learned a lot about MapReduce and had to think a lot about the optimization of mapreduce tasks in the future. Overall, pretty good problem set, would do again. 
",4
331,fl18,hw3,155C20Z,"This is my third homework. It mainly discusses about the running of a MapReduce job, the problem of skew and MapReduce Job using YARN. I think the first problem is quite simple, I just literally following the instructions. The second one and the third one require additional readings. The answers cannot be fully searched on the slides which gonna takes some time. 
In all, I think hw3 can have 4 stars.
",4
332,fl18,hw3,18EC32Z,"I thought that this homework was fairly straightforward. Like the previous homeworks, it allowed us to reinforce ideas we learned in lab and lecture such as YARN scheduling and MapReduce. Additionally, we got to explore HDFS outputs in more depth, which allows for some practical experience. I also thought that skew part was interesting even though we may not have discussed it in class.
",4
333,fl18,hw3,20F7A7Z,"I think this homework was very thorough. To answer the questions it took reviewing the information learned in lecture and ensuring that you understood it. It was a good mix of of simple understanding/recounting and more complicated analysis of the concepts in these lectures. I think this was a reasonablehw assignment and was relatively enjoyable.
",4
334,fl18,hw3,4B4605Z,"This homework was interesting - it really helped me understand more about how Map Reduce works, especially in terms of distribution of work across worker nodes in a cluster. I also understood better how parallelism helps and why we don't want maximum parallelism, or new tasks for each key, given the concept of skew. I gave it 4 stars.
",4
335,fl18,hw3,7086E1Z,"The third homework is about dealing with some problems that existed in MapReduce work and inspire me to find a proper solution to them. This homework gives good example of MapReduce. It also encourages us to read about sentiment analysis and Hadoop MapReduce job execution, which is really helpful for me.
",4
336,fl18,hw3,7B87F0Z,"I liked this homework assignment a lot more than previous assignments. I feel I learned more about the MapReduce framework from all the reading required for this assignment. It's possible that it's only because everything is finally sinking in, but that's beside the point.
",4
337,fl18,hw3,81D8FEZ,"When I have done the lab2 for preparing the first question, I learned more about the process of MapReduce, and considered more about the results of this process.

The second problem is a little hard for me, I was not sure if I understand the “skew” right for this problem...

The last question helped me to review the last class’s content very well, and knew the knowledge about data locality optimization.


",4
338,fl18,hw3,863B82Z,"This assignment was pretty long and required a lot backtracking through previous slides and book material. I also feel that the information covered was very useful in understanding how the Hadoop infrastructure works. Overall, while I still feel like a more hands-on homework assignment would have been more interesting, this homework assignment still covered fairly interesting and useful subjects. I feel like it is a bit hard to verify whether or not any given answer is correct for this set of questions. 
",4
339,fl18,hw3,8B9689Z,This homework was fairly simple in terms of what was expected. The labs seems to help quite a lot when completing the homework so i found this to be easy and was happy with the content. The reading portion of the homework was not bad itself because it was not that much. Now i have a better understanding of YARN thanks to the homework.,4
340,fl18,hw3,A2D4B6Z,"This was a really good homework. It was great to try my hand at actually executing a MapReduce and dseeing the output, not to mention how it almost froze and crashed my computer the first time I tried it. Learning about the practicalities of MapReduce jobs was also great, as well as being asked to think about what we can do to make it bettesr (sentiment analysis). I didn't really understand the usefulness of YARN but maybe I will through the next assignment.
",4
341,fl18,hw3,A3354FZ,"These problems are really good review for learning lecture notes. I am really enjoy this problem, we can get a deep learning  of the properties of Map reduce and use the practice to consolidate what I have learned.
",4
342,fl18,hw3,A67BB6Z,"This homework provided helpful insight on how the MapReduce job runs, by giving me a chance to think about possible improvements, roles of different nodes, what the RecordReader is, and how Reduce Tasks outputs files into HDFS. Furthermore, I had a chance to compare the tradeoffs when dealing with data skew, which is a new concept learned from this homework. Finally, I could review the MapReduce processes and YARN daemons and their respective roles either on Master Node or Worker Node. Data locality optimization was an interesting concept for it was a bit ironic in a way that we are trying to schedule as much tasks locally(while we are learning virtual machine), and it indeed broadened my scope in job scheduling and execution.",4
343,fl18,hw3,A92B1AZ,"I thought that this homework really made me think a lot about the processes that surround map reduce alogorithms. It made me really have to dig down and understand the basics of what was going on. I had to understand the different daemons and processes, how they work and how exactly they interact with each other. I am looking forward to implementing my own map reduce algorithms.
",4
344,fl18,hw3,AAF8D6Z,"I like this homework more than the previous one. It does help me understand how map reduce is implemented, and it does not include the tedious reading problems like the first one. But I do prefer some coding assignment for this. Also I wish to have some the later homework to be more definite.",4
345,fl18,hw3,B3D9D3Z,"this homework covers a lot of lectures in class and needs a more comprehensive understanding of the materials we have covered so far. I feel happy that this homeword solidify my knowledge and understanding of the materials. and I am ready to learn more from this class. 
",4
346,fl18,hw3,B68C78Z,"I really like the first question in hw3! From it, I can see that the code can be put into practical use. When trying to process the wordCount function and seeing what’s going on in HDFS, I get to know more about what we learned in class. When it comes to problem 2, I get to know a new thing — skew and by reading the book and PPT, I learned the detail of it and as we are required to analyze 3 situations in this problem. I found that when I read the book for the first time, I didn’t understand it thoroughly and as a result I read it again. For the last problem, I think It’s another kind of review of the class and it’s interesting.
",4
347,fl18,hw3,B7035CZ,"I feel better in this homework than previous ones, because after staring coding I feel easier to understand how Hadoop and MapReduce work. I can gradually visualize the process of running such a program. This homework helps me to review Yarn management and how data is transferred to DataNodes and written back to HDFS. I tried the word count program and it was fantastic.
",4
348,fl18,hw3,BF7834Z,"The lab is good and detalied for answering the question 1's (1) and (2). And the following question, I thinked a lot. At the begining, I counldn't understand some details, by discussing with my teammate, actually, I understand the mapreducedeeper. So I think the homework is good for review and by reading the textbook and search from Internet. I learned more.
",4
349,fl18,hw3,C0915AZ,"Homework three took me a lot of time to finish, and probably it took the longest time comparing to former ones. The reason I think is that there are a lot of things I need to discover from textbook or website like YARN, sentimental analysis, and completely understand them needs a lot of time. But still I think it really worth it because I learned a lot.
",4
350,fl18,hw3,C3C00CZ,"I liked the first part of the assigment where we used the command line to run the mapreduce job. I also liked the 2nd question, because I think that the skew is important to think about. I was not a fan of the third question because it was too open-ended, and I wasn't sure what I was supposed to include in my answer. ",4
351,fl18,hw3,CD4772Z,"This homework was the best homework out of the 3 that I've done so far. The homework didn't require as much writing as the previous ones and therefore took less time to do. The questions in this homework also seem to be less vague than the other two, making it much easier to complete the homework.
",4
352,fl18,hw3,D2B1D1Z,":This homework is not so difficult for me. Most answers of problems can e found in lecture slides or text book. But some questions are troublesome. Although I know that the solutions are right there in the book. I need to read the materials carefully and make a summary. The problem 1 is awesome. Because it let me excute the map reduce program by myself so that I can get a deep impressiion on how it works. By searching specific words in the output file, I got a chance to learn about what does the result look like. I think it is really cool
",4
353,fl18,hw3,DA142FZ,"In this homework. I completed three parts. In the first part, I ran the code and got the results for the homework. Which is great! On the second part, I answered three question about the phonomenon of skew. And I explained some methods to reduce the skew by probability and statistics knowledge. Among this home work, I got more familiar with the process of MapReduce and the master controller. I got more familiar with the philosophy of the process, like how does it work, and what is the benefit doing so?
",4
354,fl18,hw3,DC110CZ,"This homework, as frustrating as it was, definitely taught me a lot about the basics of Hadoop MapReduce. I found myself consulting the textbooks and lecture slides quite a bit, and though it was work to flip around different sources to find the answers I was looking for, it forced me to learn the material much more deeply that I may have otherwise. In the future, I might prefer more problem-oriented problems, rather than open-ended conceptual problems, but that's just a personal preference.",4
355,fl18,hw3,F52E65Z,"I think that problem 3 is not a good problem, this problem didn't give a clear meaning, this really confused me because I really don't know what to do, how to do. THe other two problems are ok, they didn't confuse me.
",4
356,fl18,hw3,F6ADB8Z,This homework is pretty challenging. The answer is not so obvious to see. You have to dig into the lecture notes or the reading material to find the correct answer. Problem 1 is about running a MapReduce job. It involves resource manager Hadoop operations. Problem 2 is focus on the skewness during a MapReduce job. I find it interesting cause it's not been thoroughly talked about in class. Problem 3 is about the locality of files. ,4
357,fl18,hw4,0B219FZ,"Homework 4 is fun! We explored the overall sentiment of Shakespeare’s poem and this is what I have not done before.
I think the instructor should spend more time on explaining how the Hadoop framework works (e.g. how the command line is parsed by ToolRunner and GenericOptionsParser, and where it is stored after parsing & how it is passed to Mapper / Reducer / Partitioner).


",4
358,fl18,hw4,155C20Z,"This is my forth homework. It is getting more challenging. A large proportion of this homework is codding. The two problems are about mainly about using toolrunner to pass a parameter and implementing a partitioner to assign different job to different reducers. Since we have slides and comments, I have many hints when tackling the problems. In all, I will rate 4 stars.
",4
359,fl18,hw4,31B886Z,"Homework4 is great! It contains Lab3 and we can learn the processes how wordcount and average length function works. It also immproves my knowledge about driver, mapper and reducer. Mapper maps input key/value pairs to a set of intermediate key/value pairs. Ruducer reduces a set of intermediate values whichs share a key to a smaller set of values. They are very useful in hadoop.
",4
360,fl18,hw4,502392Z,"while there were setup challenges for this homework, it prepares students to start writing and testing their own map reduce jobs based off required functionality. One instruction was ambiguous when it asked for the ""command for this the hw4.pdf file."" Students will be confused by this instruction. I feel more confident after completing this homework. 
",4
361,fl18,hw4,7086E1Z,"The fourth homework is about setting up job configuration through command line by using ToolRunner, and implementing customized Partitioner. Unlike former homework, this one is more practical and allow me to write the code myself to implement all the stuff. Throughout this homework, I successfully made a prototype of sentiment analysis which is very inspiring. It is about using the knowledge I learned from course in to practice. Through this practice, I learned many more about job configuration in ToolRunner and Partitioner.
",4
362,fl18,hw4,8254EFZ,"This homework was fun, except when I was trying to figure out the ""Implement a Partitioner using the stubs SentimentPartitioner.java provided in your SVN repository"" part. I initially thought I had to edit the Partitioner in the native folder, and incorporate into job execution (somehow) using the Distributed Cache. I had to do a LOT of research in order to confirm my skepticism, and indeed make a new Java class object within the src. Perhaps the instructinos could have been clearer, but I generally, it was fun and practical. 
",4
363,fl18,hw4,942FB2Z,"I found HW4 to be very enjoyable. It was nice and fun to start coding and actually apply what we learned in class. I enjoyed how this homework was connected to homework 3 regarding the sentiment values, and also kind of connects to our providing this feedback. The information in the slides were sufficient to complete the lab in a reasonable amount of time.
",4
364,fl18,hw4,9CAEDDZ,"This homework was much longer than the previous ones. However, it was also my favorite one so far. This homework was more focused on coding different map reduce problems in Java and learning the concepts through implementation, rather than simply asking written questions that can be found by reading the book.
",4
365,fl18,hw4,A67BB6Z,"This homework was especially helpful in that it helps us practice implementing mapreduce, with driver class method, toolrunner method, and distributed cache method. However, this homework was a lot of work, and took much longer than usual. Also, for the sentiment partitioner portion of the homework, I feel like there were some errors in the pre-defined codes and there wasn't much instruction on what the methods of Partitioner was for.
",4
366,fl18,hw4,BF0535Z,"This homework i would say is a big hands on expereince and refered back to the previous labs alot for helps with hadoop. I really liked it and i think it helps a lot building up the understanding. however i think the instructions should contain more information or guidence or help so when we are doing the labs and homework we will get more idea of why some results is happening, or we can troubleshoot with more insights and likelihood to identify the problem ourself. other than what i just mentioned, i also think that the homework is a bit too long.",4
367,fl18,hw4,C0915AZ,"This homework I think is good. It help me gain a lot of hands-on experiences and help me have a better understanding about job configuration and partitioner. Also it helped me to know about how to debug a MapReduce project. Homework 4 did not take me so much time than homework 3 which I think is really good.
",4
368,fl18,hw4,C7D69DZ,"I thought that this homework was more challenging than the previous three homeworks because we had to implement our own MapReduce this time. We had to go to TA hours this time to get clarification on some of the instructions, which I thought were a bit vague. The part about the Distributed Cache in problem #2 was a little hard to grasp. But because we struggled a little more in this assignment, I feel like I learned a lot.
",4
369,fl18,hw4,D2B1D1Z,"This homework is kind of difficult for me. Writing codes for problem 1 and problem 2 sometimes makes me anxious, especially when there were some bugs in the program but I can not find them. That feels terrible. But once I finished the job and everything were all set, the feel change immediately. I felt proud of myself because I can finish such a hard work. In a word, the process is tough but the result is awesome. So I do love this homework. 
",4
370,fl18,hw4,F6846AZ,"h4 4 is a little bit harder than previous homework because the first time it demands the code work. I take much time to fimilar with the hadoop programming stuff.
",4
371,fl18,hw5,0B219FZ,"Homework five has great practical implication. Building an inverted index using Hadoop Map Reduce helps me understand how an index behind a book is constructed. I learned to use Local Job Runner from this homework (also set up my local development environment on Windows and IntelliJ IDEA), which greatly improved my development efficiency.",4
372,fl18,hw5,0CE6FFZ,"homework 5 so far is most time consuming homework among all the 427s assignments so far. I will rate this homework as neutral since some of the questions are somewhat ambiguous. But the coding part is fun and challenging. Although it took me a long time to actually figure out how the secondary sort works, I've benefit a lot from it. There are definitely space for improvements, but overall this homework is ok.
",4
373,fl18,hw5,0D3DD8Z,"This hw was more interesting than the other ones. It helped me figure out how to use the toolrunner configurations to the fullest extent, and it also helped me understand comparators. I did think that problem 1 was a bit annoying in the fact that it didn't deviate much from the structure of the file that you had. But, overall, it was pretty enjoyable. 
",4
374,fl18,hw5,155C20Z,"This is my fifth homework. It is mainly about custom key/value pairs and secondary sort. Homework 5 is pretty challenging, just like homework 4. Meanwhile, I am not sure whether the answers are correct for a couple of questions from hw 5. i guess it's because the hint from code comment and slides is limited. And I can only be satisfied unless I figure out the correct answers. In all, I' ll give 4 stars.
",4
375,fl18,hw5,20F7A7Z,"I think this homework was alright. It introduced us to a few new concepts that were very useful, but it was also relatively slow. I wish we could have made a custom writable class, done secondary sort, and learned how to use different input formats all in the same driver class. Sometimes the work becomes very tedious when having to create a bunch of different jobs. It helps to have some more experience, but it's never conceptually hard or interesting.
",4
376,fl18,hw5,254574Z,"I did not like this as much as other assignments. Generally I just felt that, especially for problem two, the instructions were just very unclear, making it difficult to know what was actually being asked of us. It does tickle me that the way to return oldest first is to remove a line of configuration and just use the default though. Problem 3 was also unclearly instructed, but I think our final product looks fun.
",4
377,fl18,hw5,26044FZ,"I think this homework is a meaningful one.
Many knowledge is examined in this homework such as secondary sort, custom writables, custom comparator, custom partitioner.
But i think professor could give us more difficult task. And the task needs to be more practical.
Therefore, this homework is good but not the best.
",4
378,fl18,hw5,2EA398Z,"Homework for homework 5 is more about the practice than the theory, which is great to me. But on the other hand, it will takes me more time to figure out the overall logic and make the MapReduce jobs running. It is challenge though, yet interesting. If we could have some examples for the codes, rather than giving a general solution, I think it could help us to understand the codes and the job more concretely.
",4
379,fl18,hw5,31B886Z,"This week's homework is not too hard, but it still costs me a lot of time to do it. At first, I am not familiar with writing code so this code takes me a lot of time to finish it. Then I have to run them and answer the statement queations. These also takes me a lot of time. I hope the next homework will be easy.`
",4
380,fl18,hw5,4B4605Z,"This homework was very helpful in allowing me to practice writing and understanding the components of a map-reduce job, especially the purpose of a partitioner and comparator, and to some degree, what all goes into the configuration of the job as well. I was a bit thrown off by the InvertedIndex problem because I felt that we didn't really discuss enough about InputFormats in class to intuitively know what to do.
4/5 Stars
",4
381,fl18,hw5,52D3E3Z,"This homework is pretty interesting in my opinion. I thought it has a good balance of understanding the theory  or concept and using the material in actual problems. Implementing the material is still, in my opinion, easier than understanding the concepts. Once I understand the concept, it is not as bad to implement everything. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5. 
",4
382,fl18,hw5,57AE00Z,"I liked the problems in homework 5. I had fun thinking about how the partitioner could work to do a global sort, and why the output is not by default sorted globally. I like that these problems have real-world applications, like for this one to be able to quickly and efficienty pull out the oldest or youngest person from a list of names. One thing that confused me is why we would want the youngest person by last name, and not full name. Oh well, it's ok for me to disagree since that's a pretty easy fix.
",4
383,fl18,hw5,5C67BEZ,"hw5 was an ok homework. It was a bit painful at first, but it got better after I got the gist of it. I do wish that there were more instructions guiding us alone the assignment. As an example, nobody told me that the inputFormat from problem 3 was an interface of some kind. I had to read through hadoop's javadoc to understand what the question was asking. I do hope the difficulty for this class comes from actual thinking instead of ambiguity.
",4
384,fl18,hw5,70BB65Z,"This homework is still as hard as the former one. I'am so exhausted. I was
not even recovered from the last homework, and now I have to do this homework.
And in fact, the next homework is already out. This is further more frustrat
ing. Actually, I didn't finish the homework when I write this review. But the
result- what I should feel after done the homework- is already known, which
is, tired.
",4
385,fl18,hw5,7CE170Z,"In this assignment, we discussed mainly about partitioners, secendary sort and many issues as codings and size of disk problems. The homework does review code part of partitions, group function of comparators, challenging map and rudces in indexedinvert problem. I get to know how to implement partitioner, group function by myself. I deeply understand how to implement a mapreduce program in all the details.
",4
386,fl18,hw5,8B9689Z,"This homework was useful in understanding the concepts of partitioners and comparators. However, the wording on the homework was bad and made it difficult to understand what it was asking for. Questions 3 was easy to understand however questions 1 and 2 had some questions which were frustrating. Overall, this was an okay homework. ",4
387,fl18,hw5,92394EZ,I enjoyed doing this homework. I think that I got very familiar creating and running map reduce jobs. It was nice to be able to create a job without a lot of direction. I feel much more confident in my ability to actually write map reduce now. Acquiring these skills is making the class fun.,4
388,fl18,hw5,95A139Z," found this assignment to be interesting. Learning about hidden traps in sorting the output of map reduce jobs was very new and in general the lab brought up some cool ideas. I did enjoy more coding but found some of the questions to be very ambiguous which is never good.
",4
389,fl18,hw5,9CAEDDZ,"I enjoyed this homework for the same reason that I enjoyed the previous one. Most of this homework involved coding implementations of map reduce. There was still a fair bit of purely conceptual material, but that was not a major portion. I do feel that this one was a little too long, though.
",4
390,fl18,hw5,A2D4B6Z,"This homework was really fun to do while remaining challenging at the same time. It was interesting to learn about how we can use different ways of sorting in conjunction with mapper and reducer tasks - it seems the crux of it is just to think about what we are doing in the mapper when we take in the input. I would like to learn more about serialization in the future and how changing the input format changed how the code works.
",4
391,fl18,hw5,A67BB6Z,"This homework took the longest time of all homeworks assigned yet, but it was very helpful in a way that we had to consider the entire workflow of mapreduce, being careful of each input and output types, and implement secondary sort. While I could find all necessary information about the homework material from the slides, it could have been better if the instructor provided us with more information about Globally Sorting the output without using TotalOrderPartitioner. 
",4
392,fl18,hw5,A989D3Z,"I really like this homework because I learn a lot during the coding process. This homework is made up of 3 problems, the first problem is implementing a new program which counts the number of occurrences of each full name. This is very educative beacuse I rewrite the class of StringPairWritable and mapper and reducer, I think the most challenging part is implementing different functions including compareTo() and some other functions. The second and third problems are some Q and A about example programs.
",4
393,fl18,hw5,B2CEECZ,"For problem 1 Custom WritableComparable, I get to write a simple problem that counts the number of occurrences of each full name in a list of names.
For problem 2 Secondary Sort, I sorted the records first by last name in ascending order and then if the name is the same sort by birth year in descending order, so that the first entry per each last name is the youngest person of that last name.
For problem 3 Creating an Inverted Index, I implemented an indexer that produces an index of all the words in the text.",4
394,fl18,hw5,BE38FEZ,"In this homework, we implemented the sencondary sorting and global sorting. We can use partitioner to assign different mapper output to different reducer so that we can achieve the gloval sorting. Also, we can use function set up to reduce the redundant steps. Meanwhile, testing locally can reduce many time than testing in HDFS.
",4
395,fl18,hw5,CACBA2Z,"Homework 5 was not my favorite homework but I understand the value of it. The homework helped as I better understand how to make a quality mapreduce program and how to integrate partitioners and toolrunners with it. The first problem of the homework and how we were using StringPairWritable with the rest of the program was a bit confusing and I would have liked the directions to be a bit more clear. The secondary sort was also a bit confusing but I liked it a bit more because it made you think more about what is actually going on behind a mapreduce program and it made us change the program a little bit to accomplish a different goal that was originally intended when the program was made. Overall I think the homework was a good learning experience but wish the directions were a bit more clear.
",4
396,fl18,hw5,D8E4A3Z,"I think this homewok 5 is a very helpful one. It has many coding practise, which really helps me understanding the concept of the mapreduce function, especially the question of global sorting. This realy teach me a lot. However, there are some describtion that is not clear enough, fir example, the key distribution in question 2. I have never heard this term before, so I think it is better to provide some link to the term if we are not familiar with it. Anyway, it is an excellent homework for me. ",4
397,fl18,hw5,DB927AZ,"As a coding homework, it tests me on my coding ability and the understanding of the second sorting and global sorting, which is much more difficult than previous homework. I believe that I have done this homework correctly, but I am not so confidently about it. In general, I believe that this homework is well designed.
",4
398,fl18,hw5,F6ADB8Z,"This homework is about multiple keys, secondary sort and write your own mapper, reducer. The content is pretty fun. But I found the instruction of problem 1 and problem 2 to be confusing. The directory of problem 1 was wrong, and fixed later. The instruction of 2 didn't specificly say the form of sample output, so I figured out after a long time. 
",4
399,fl18,hw5,FFBEA4Z,"I enjoyed homework 5 because I found it interesting, although it took me a substantial period of time to complete because it was more work than some previous assignments.  I also found the instructions to be unclear in some places and they had to be explained to me by a ta.  For example, when unzipping the data, it would not be formatted properly unless I unzipped the data on my local machine and then transferred it, but I didn't think this was made clear in the instructions.  Overall, though, I feel that it enhanced my understanding of the concepts.

",4
401,fl18,hw6,0B219FZ,"I was asked to implement a MapReduce program from scratch in homework 6, which is challenging and daunting. However, the homework / lab instruction pointed to Mahmoud Parsian's code example, which greatly helped my work. Overall, homework six is an easy one. I would love to know how to chain jobs, as has been posted on Piazza.",4
402,fl18,hw6,155C20Z,"This is my sixth homework. It is mainly about making a Top N list. I need to write two jobs which is quite challenging, but I get some hints from github referenced in the lab instruction. I came across some problems when debugging locally using Eclipse and it was much easier to solve the problems. However, when submitting the job to Hadoop, I encountering new problems which was quite challenging. I will rate this hw6 a 4 stars.
",4
403,fl18,hw6,18EC32Z,"I thought that this homework was valuable. I enjoyed using movie data for the first part as I really enjoy watching movies. I also thought the combiner part was informative, I understood combiners at a high level going in but now I feel like I understand the details of combiners.
",4
404,fl18,hw6,298071Z,"I gave this hw a 4/5 (as i seem to do most weeks). I felt there was not much direction in makeing the mapreduce progeam which is good except for when it is unclear of exactly how jobs should be combined and such. However, it made me review quite a bit regarding mapreduce programs and I likes how it was mostly application with fewer questions as well as how it mostly revolve around one program instead of lots of smaller things which allwed me to put all of my focus on one thing. It did take quite a while though especially in problem 1 because of the unclear directions


",4
405,fl18,hw6,31B886Z,"Homework 6 is not very difficult, but it still takes me a lot of time to do it because I have lots of confusions about some conceptions. I have to check the book and slides again and again in order to understand them. And the lab5 really helps me a lot about the homework. At first I really don't know how to write the code, then the examples show me how to write them and made me work more easily!
",4
406,fl18,hw6,52D3E3Z,"Initially I thought this homework will be a relatively easy homework,because most of the code are already given in the example (from github). However, when implementing it, we found the homework be more difficult than we expected. Because we are using someone else's code, we have to make sure we understand everything he wrote and then continue. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5. 
",4
407,fl18,hw6,5C67BEZ,"hw6 was okay. this week was fall break. So, I didn't really want to spend too much on this homework. It wasn't that hard to be honest. I didn't have to write the standard sum reducer, so that was very neat. There are so many things in a map reduce job that is standard to every job.
",4
408,fl18,hw6,7086E1Z,"In the sixth homework we learned to implement two MapReduce jobs by our own. One is similar to word count job and the other one is Top-N-List job.

410,fl18,hw6,7B87F0Z,"Star Rating: 4

This was my favorite homework assignment so far. I enjoyed how open ended-the questions were and hw much freedom we had to create our own map and reduce functions. Working with multiple jobs was fun as well. Looking forward to working with python and spark.
",4
411,fl18,hw6,8254EFZ,"The first problem was very nice. The only issue, though, was that the code that the hint directed us to implements a the Reducer as a Combiner already. I was very confused when I got to Problem 2, because there it tells me to implement a Combiner. Wow. Much confusion.

413,fl18,hw6,8D606DZ,"This is a nice homework. In general it is not too hard since the lab instruction gives us some written up code on GitHub so we just need to made some modification. On the other hand I did get stuck and spent a lot of time on some simple error. If there is a way to avoid it, that will be very helpful. Maybe I should try peer coding.",4
414,fl18,hw6,92394EZ,"This homework was fun to write an entire package from scratch. I think that my skills improved, but my understanding did not. I felt like this homework was more applicable and less theoretical. This kind of homework is helpful to make sure that I know how to apply what we learn in class.",4
415,fl18,hw6,942FB2Z,"HW6 was good. It definitely cleared up a lot of the confusion I had about how exactly combiners would be implemented and when they would be implemented. Doing the top N was nice since we actually got to practice a thought process that we learned during class. The questions were thought-provoking and purposeful.
",4
416,fl18,hw6,9CAEDDZ,"This was my favorite homework so far. I liked the fact that this homework was almost entirely coding.

417,fl18,hw6,A3354FZ,"HW6 Extra problem

This assignment is really good review for learning lecture notes. I am really enjoy these problems, we can get a deep learning of the properties of top-n-list and the function of combiner. The practice consolidates what I have learned.
",4
418,fl18,hw6,A3A0C4Z,"I gave this homework assignment a rating of 4 stars. I thought it was a good introduction to getting us to write a MapReduce job entirely from scratch. Also the second part was a good way of getting us to see some statistics as to how our jobs are actually running. For example, the job looks the same when run with or without a combiner, but under the hood, the combiner is actually making a large difference as to how efficiently the job is running. Overall this was a good homework assignment.

422,fl18,hw6,C0915AZ,"Homework six I think is a very practical one, becuase the two problem it contains both very related to real world application, which I think is very good. I leaned a lot about how to write a useful MR programe as well as how to analyze the the statistic recorded by YARN. And I thinks this homeword don't need too much time which is good.

423,fl18,hw6,C7D69DZ,"I thought that this homework assignment was fine. It was interesting to use a real-life sample of data in the first section when we found the top N most popular movies from the Netflix data. It was cool to see movies that I recognized as popular movies show up as the most popular ones from the MapReduce job. I learned a lot more about combiners in the second part of the homework assignment, which I thought was useful. 
",4
424,fl18,hw6,DD61E5Z,"I would rate this assignment a 4/5 because it effectively taught me how to write my own map 
reduce program and helped me understand the importance of combiners. Although this homework
was better than ones in the past, I feel like the assignments could be more exciting to work. 
This one was better because I can see how I could use this in the real world and the movie 
aspect was more exciting and enjoyable to work with than previous assignments.

425,fl18,hw6,F6846AZ,"The workload of hw6 is a little slighter the hw5. Because there in tutorial code for problem 1 shown in the lab ppt, the difficulty is greatly reduced. I think this work could be harder without the detailed tutorial code in lab ppt link. What's more the probem 2 gives me a better understanding of how combiner works and how to monitor the job on the web port.",4
426,fl18,hw6,FFBEA4Z,"This homework was pretty good, because I prefer implementation questions to conceptual questions.  Overall, the workload was reasonable and the material was interesting.  Unfortunately, the instructions for problem 2b were unclear and confusing.  Besides that, the lab was pretty intuitive although it was difficult to debug.  I also thought the combiner counter comparison was interesting and helpful, because it allowed me to see what the combiner was actually doing.

427,fl18,hw7,0B219FZ,"The first problem of homework 7 turned out to be an easy one, which I originally thought should be quite hard, since co-occurrence is a difficult topic in the slides (we have so many pages of slides!) The other two problems did not require coding, which is a breeze for me. Love the homework!",4
428,fl18,hw7,0CE6FFZ,"for homework 7, I think it is a good practice for me to have a better understanding of the bit tough materials that was covered during the lecture. I rated above average since I think some of the questions are meaningful yet challenging. Question 1 covers the co-occurrence problem, and I'm having fun doing this question. I like question 2 the best since it is a good refresh for me to understand the relationships between different similarity function. Question 3 is also a good practice of knowing how the collaborative filtering actually works. Overall I rate this homework above average.
",4
429,fl18,hw7,11A4CEZ,"Of course, another one. I can't say whether it's good or bad because I was unsure about lot's of problems in this homework. It took me much longer to finally finish it. Part of the reasons probably was that my teammate was not as helpful as he was last time, which was reasonable because the course are getting harder. There were some problems that I knew they were mensioned in class but could bearly remember it. Maybe I'm just too old for this. Last but not least, as always, please give me more of this so I can loss more hair.

430,fl18,hw7,155C20Z,"This is my seventh homework. It is mainly about solving word co-occurence, and some questions about collaborative filtering. This is a quite challenging homework. Some of the questions cost my teammate and me a lot of time and are still not sure of the answers. I think I need to spend more time review what I have learnt recently. In all, I will rate hw7 a 4 star.

431,fl18,hw7,298071Z,"I gave this hw a 4/5. This homeworks was different than the last two in that it was more conceptual than just coding, which is kind of nice 
as the coding can be very time consuming when you run into errors which may take a lot of googling to solve. The last problem was a bit conusing as I was not sure what they were really asking for and computing the cosine values for such sparse data is confusing. Overall it was an okay homework I just wish the directions had been a bit more clear regarding the written responses.

432,fl18,hw7,31B886Z,"Homework7 is not too difficult for me, but it takes me a lot of time to do it. Because I have a lot of confusions about some conceptions. I check the book and slides again and again in order to understand them. I am also confused about some algorithms and I do not really understand the difference between them. It makes very difficult for me to solve problem2 and problem3. I search many books and resources on the Internet to find the answers.

The last question was also very helpful because I got a better grasp on collaborative filtering by performing it on paper. The first question was a good question but I felt that those concepts were not explained well enough for me to feel good about my answers. 
Rating: 4.0/5.0

435,fl18,hw7,52D3E3Z,"I find this homework to be easier than the last one. There are more computations involved, which requires less formal writing and explanation.

436,fl18,hw7,5C67BEZ,"This homework was easy. I'll always hope for more coding problems, but that seems like not to be the focus of this class. We learned about pig and spark during the previous lectures and I'm realizing how stupid it is having to write bunch of repetitive java code trying to do the same thing over and over again. I'm so done with running hadoop with java...
",4
437,fl18,hw7,6DEC67Z,"The homework this week was fine; there were still a couple of ambiguous things, but we were able to intuit enough of them to solve everything. The last problem was probably the most challenging, because of the various technical aspects of mapreduce that we needed to take into account (the nature of group & sort, how it affects pair keys). Question 2 was definitely the most vague, but not impossible. Doable.

439,fl18,hw7,A2D4B6Z,"Using this homework i was able to see the relative simplicity of using the pairs approach to finding cooccurrences of words. I don't think it would be this simple to implement a stripes approach, and I would think that it wouldn't really be worth the effort when it comes to looking at Shakespeare's words. I'm guessing that this will be our last homework in Java and while it was really annoying testing our code using Java it was a good way to learn how everything works.

This assignment is really good review for learning lecture notes. I am really enjoy these problems, we can get a deep learning of the properties of normalization, CO-OCCURRENCE and SIMILARITY. Use the practice to consolidate what I have learned.

441,fl18,hw7,A3A0C4Z,"I gave homework 7 a 4-star rating. I thought it was once again a good way to brush up on writing MapReduce jobs from scratch. Also, it uses the counters introduced in the previous homework to actually give an idea of how efficient our job was. Also, when analyzing the correlation metrics, it was a good step away from programming and into looking into the theory behind how the data from these jobs can be used. The reason 1-star was deducted is it was a little unclear on how the pseudo code in the RS2 slides corresponds to the Job in part 1 of the assignment. 
",4
442,fl18,hw7,A912DBZ,"overall homework is ok. The second question a is a little bit confuse, and 3b requires to be solve by hand is ok, but probably solving by using hadoop can be better in pratice.

445,fl18,hw7,C0915AZ,"Homework 7 is good and not very time consuming, and it contains some question that require us to think deeper. This homework I spent around two days to finish and I believe I have learned useful things through it. Like ways to implement a recommendation system and different method for defining similarity between vectors.

446,fl18,hw7,C7D69DZ,"I thought that this was a fine homework assignment. I thought that part 1 was interesting where we had to implement the word co-occurence. I thought that this part wasn't too bad to implement and I liked seeing the different pairings of words within the shakespeare data. I found the pairs vs. stripes distinction for this particular application harder to grasp, but feel like I understand it better now. For the very last part where we did an item-item approach on the movies I thought that the calculated cosine similarities weren't very helpful because there wasn't enough data.

447,fl18,hw7,D8E4A3Z,"I think this homework is a very good one. It has both practical question and also the theorical question. And both of them is very useful and meaningful. The question is very clear and we know what to answer about. However, there are some inconsistance in the slides. For example, whether the output of reduce function should be one or two. I think we need to get informed. But, this is a very good homework. ",4
448,fl18,hw7,DB927AZ,"This is a really challenging homework which require a thorough understanding of the materials on the textbook. My partner and I met several problems on this homework.

",4
451,fl18,hw7,F603FBZ,"This homework has a relatively larger proportion related to the theoretical / concept intuition compared with implementaiton. I like this structure because it forces us to be conceptually familiar with the code we are implementing and the purpose behind it instead of just copying over the code syntax. I'm in a genrally good sentiment right now. I am excited to learn more about materials related to the recommendation system in the future
",4
452,fl18,hw7,F6ADB8Z,"For this homework, the understanding part takes over the majority instead of the coding part. I think this may because the collabrative filtering problem is relatively big and can be hard for a homework. So, without coding, the other part of this homework is pretty easy. Basically everything you need to put down on your writeup can be found on lecture notes or on books.

453,fl18,hw8,020E9BZ,"I gave hw8 a 4 because it is quite challenging to do. And also some parts of the homework depends on the data being processed in lab7, which I have to do because there was not enough time during lab section to finish it. Also I find it hard to do probably because I wasn’t really familiar with pig and ETL yet.",4
454,fl18,hw8,0CE6FFZ,"By far homework 8 is the most challenging homework. I will rate this homework as awesome because it covers almost all the materials we've discussed in the lecture and lab, and what's more is that it provides practical exercises to interact with pig and spark. After finishing the homework, I have a better and deeper understanding of pig and spark, about their advantages and disadvantages. Homework 8 is hard, but the slides and lab instructions are very helpful, so while the work is time-consuming, i will rate this homework as great.

It is not that difficult as before but it requires to have a good command of the syntax. And syntax is the issue that i spent most of the time on the homework. So, I strongly recommend that we need to first have a good knowledge and practice in syntax, then we begin to create projects.

I think the homework is very exhausting and time-consuming.",4
458,fl18,hw8,52D3E3Z,"I feel like this homework is also pretty straightforward. It combines both SPARK and PIG, which we had plenty of time to test around with during the previous labs and quizzes. Therefore, it does not feel like a very challenging homework. Also, the first three PIG problems are kind of similar, once you understand one, the others become realtively easy. I would give this homework a 4 out of 5.

459,fl18,hw8,6DEC67Z,"today's homework was ok; it was good to work on the SPARK syntax and learn some more about how it runs. I think working in the shell was a little rough and confusing; from what I can gleam it doesn't seem that most people use the shell to run code through SPARK.

462,fl18,hw8,8B9689Z,This homework was actually fun to do and really helpful in terms of learning pig and spark. It also helps doing the lab prior to the homework because it helps your understand the syntax easily.

Overall this homework seemed long but it was totally doable and easy to grasp the concept.,4
463,fl18,hw8,8D606DZ,"I feel this homework is kind of too heavy. Especially we need to complete lab7 to do this one. I don't think anyone can really finish lab7 in the lab time.

Hope the last homework could be easier.",4

465,fl18,hw8,A3A0C4Z,"I gave this homework a rating of 4 stars. I thought it was a step in the right direction in terms of having the homeworks be more application oriented. Since there was a lot of code-based problems, we really got our hands dirty and solved realistic problems. Also the notion of the tasks in the lab being for made-up companies is a good way to stress how useful the techniques/technologies we are learning can be in the real world.

471,fl18,hw8,DA142FZ,"I pretty like this time's homework. The assignment tested us skills with Pig. And with the application of the PIG, we use it to find out key words of high values and sites with low costs. We uses PIG to manage our database locally and we do not need to write Java code. Also managing the local data base is easier than the distributed file system, because the ditributed file system is not mutable in the usual case.

It was annoying when transformations were taking forever such as join, but I suppose that's a good lesson in preprocessing data to be efficient. What I really didn't like however was that we tried to go to TA hours on Friday and there were no TAs; that's very unprofessional. Also, there were a lot of repeat questions and questions with incorrect information, which was a pain to figure out on our own.

496,fl18,hwM,18EC32Z,"This homework was interesting as we got to see how PageRank works on a real webgraph with many pages and links. It was good to see that our PageRank implementation produced meaningful results, in that the UC school websites were the websites with the highest PageRanks. This makes sense when thinking about the sheer size of the UC system (I believe that the system is the largest employer in the state) and the fact that those sites link to each other.

498,fl18,hwM,9CDF20Z,"I think this homework assignment was somewhat useful in my learning of Cloud Computing. The TAs did not have a good understanding of the subject matter since it was a new assignment, as I feel that it contributed significantly to my understanding of the subject matter. I think this assignment was very prone to small errors that messed up the whole code and was very time consuming. If one of the 200 iteration runs was wrong it wasted too much time to be of any help. Thank you for your consideration! I appreciate the evaluation and opportunity to gain extra credit.

(1) First problem is really good review for learning lecture notes. I am really enjoy this problem, we can get a deep learning  of the pagerank and use the practice to consolidate what I have learned.

(2) for problem 2, a really good practice, but ti take abour 2 hours to run the script.

(3) very good practice based on real problems

501,fl18,hwM,A92B1AZ," thought that this homework was a little redudndant on the coding end because it felt that the solutions were not that new in terms of how it made me think. I think the write ups helped me understabd that material a little better so I liked that part. I'm looking forward to more homework assignment that explore the coding assigmnets a little more.

502,fl18,hw1,020E9BZ,"In this homework, problem one is the easiest problem and it simply asks you to review the 5 Big Data characteristics and apply them to three instances, so it does not take a not a lot of time to complete, which is good. I think that problem two is most interesting problem because it involves challenging mathematical thinking. I personally don’t really like problem three because I don’t like reading things, but overall I would give this homework a rating of five since I like problem two so much.",5
503,fl18,hw1,05A511Z,"I think this homework is a very great introduction to Big data application. It makes us think about the concept before jumpping into actual code and math. However, I think some concepts in the ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data"" are hard to understand based on the materials we had now. Anyway, I like this homework pretty much. Thank you.",5
504,fl18,hw1,155C20Z,"This is my first homework of cse427s. Everything is very fresh. I start learning new knowledge about big data. Meanwhile, the first homework is not difficult, but it does take a while to fully complete all the requirements, especially reading a paper for an international student. Additionally, the second problem concerning evil-doers is very interesting and I enjoy it very much. I wish to keep doing well in the future.
",5
505,fl18,hw1,18EC32Z,I thought that this homework was fairly straightforward and a good introductory homework. The first part allowed us to better understand big data characteristics and how they exist in some concrete examples. The second part allowed us to apply some math from the textbook. I thought that the article in the third part was interesting. Writing about the data-based approach described in the article and its limitations allowed us to better understand the approach.,5

Yes! I learned a lot of meaningful things from this homework!   
",5
507,fl18,hw1,1EBAB4Z,"It was a good homework. The first question helped me assess whether I understood the topics discussed in the first lecture. The second question demonstrated well that when we have big data, if we are not careful when we are setting our parameters, we will end up with false positives. The paper reading question was helpful because it discussed a practical approach and its limitations.",5
508,fl18,hw1,48CF23Z,"I think this assignment is not so difficult and a little bit interesting. Question 1 is simple, and it helps me remind the knowledge mentioned in the class. Question 2 is about how random data, regarded as noise, could affect the data mining, and the calculation is easy too. I need to read a paper in question 3, which spend me a lot of time, but it really makes sense.",5
509,fl18,hw1,502392Z,"I think this was a good homework to test basic understanding of big data definitions. The examples are applicable and thought provoking. The Bonferroni’s Principle question challenged our probability and pattern recognition skills and outlined syntax that may be useful later in the course. I didn’t particularly like the reading based question but that is because I learn better from non-text sources.




",5
510,fl18,hw1,7CE170Z,"Homework1 actually help me understand fundamental concepts of Big Data followed by problems. It includes characteristics of Big Data, Big data Models and what approaches did sicientists use with its limits. I spent some time on homework1 and work out those problems by following instructions of slides, textbook, readings and previous knowledge.
Furthermore, it enhances my comprehension to Big Data and how does the models work with actual problem.
",5
511,fl18,hw1,9466D0Z,"For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in class about the characteristic of big data. Through this, I not only remember what the characteristic is, but also have a deep understanding about what actually the characteristic is. 
For problem 2, the question asks us to read something first, and then do a similar problem. The knowledge is based on the probability which we learned in undergrad. But there is a little trick thing that the textbook does not mention a detailed process about how to calculate the probability about living in the same hotel. We need to think carefully when do the homework by ourselves, otherwise, we might not be able to get the test examples past. 
For problem 3, the question asks us to read an article and do some reading problems. To tell the truth, I am not good at summarizing the info from the article. I think all info would be useful. So this problem takes a lot of time for me. But I still think that this is a good practice for me, since the costed time would be shorter if I practice more.

",5
512,fl18,hw1,9E9721Z,"1st homework is very helpful for me to understand the course material. 
The 1st and 3rd problem makes me undestand concept much more clearly.
The 2nd problem is not too difficult, it give me an example of limits of statistical learning.
The homework is not difficult but it need lot's of time to finish it.
",5
513,fl18,hw1,AAF8D6Z,"To be honest, the HW1 is a bit more interesting than I expected. Especailly for the 2nd question. It uses a vivic metaphor to states that a method that we believe is useful and are used to mine data could actually return more false positives. 
I would say this HW is positivly good. Because it reveals the charicteristics of the big data, and helps me to undersatand the materials deeper. ",5
514,fl18,hw1,BBFB04Z,"Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and some research paper is really helpful to me to understand the content coming from class. However, I do think adding more material that related with real world application will benefit. Overall, I enjoy HW1.
",5
515,fl18,hw1,C7D69DZ,"Overall, I thought that this was a nice homework assignment. It allowed us to directly apply what we learned in class about the characteristics of big data to three different examples, which I thought reinforced the material well. The second problem was enjoyable in the way that we applied the thought process of determining the number of evil-doers to a new puzzle. We missed one small part of our equation at first, but fixed it quickly. In general, I feel like I understand what big data is to a much greater extent.
",5
516,fl18,hw1,D2B1D1Z,"In my opinion,this homework is meaningful.  I get a better understanding about the big data characters and some examples. It is interesting to put Bonferroni's Principle in a pritical problem and then solve the ploblem. What is more, by reading the artical, I do extract some useful modern approches about data set processing and their drawbacks andlimits. 
",5
517,fl18,hw1,DB927AZ,"Even thought this homework seems easy to complete, it allows me to reflect on the concept and different characteristics of big data. Problem 2 helps me review the basic knoledge of statistics. The essay ""The unreasonable effectiveness of data"" inspires me to think about the difficulty of natural language processing. I use this opportunity to think about the pros and cons of each approach to this problem, which enhances my understanding of big data analysis. 
",5
518,fl18,hw1,EC9623Z,"I like homework1 is because it gives me some space to think about data from another perspective, which is the limits of data mining. Nowadays, so many talk about big data, leading to most opinions that we can always dig something out only if we have sufficient data. However, truth is not like this, as shown in probelm 2. I teaches us that when people go creazy about big data, we should also stop for a moment and analyze problems using scientific methods, avioding focusing on only one thing blindly.
",5
519,fl18,hw2,05A511Z,"I think this homework is also a good one. It makes me more familiar with the command lines in HDFS and the procedure of map reduce.

520,fl18,hw2,0CE6FFZ,"Homework 2 does a very good job at review the materials covered during the lab and lecture. The first problem involves some of the key concepts in HDFS and I actually need to read the book vary carefully to answer some of the questions. The problem also reminds me to read the book so that I can memorize the concepts. Problem 2 and 3 are my favorite problems so far because tackled the practical mapreduce question, and they both served as great practicing examples. I'm very satisfied with this homework overall.

them better.

5/5 stars
",5
523,fl18,hw2,18EC32Z,"I thought that this homework was good. It really reinforced some ideas that we went over in class, such as how a Hadoop Distributed File System works and how MapReduce works. In particular, I really enjoyed the MapReduce problems as we got to see how it works on a small scale.",5
524,fl18,hw2,1BA8DEZ,"Homework 2 is a good exercise for me. It helps me with the definition of Map function, Reduce function, and the HDFS. I also reviewed Lab 1 in this assignment. I can use what I have learned in the lab, like different commands in Linux and Hadoop, to manipulate data. It is really cool to me.
",5
525,fl18,hw2,1C39DFZ,"HW2 is a good one, you need to understand what you are really doing, and you need to analyse the problem carefully in order to get the right answer. The problems are not seperated, but connected really close, for example, problem 2 and 3 are close. The connected problems give you a full understanding of the knowledge you get. Anyway, it's a good assignment.

532,fl18,hw2,9466D0Z,"For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lab and from textbook about the Distributed File System. Through this, I not only remember what the mechanism of distributed file system is, but also have a deep understanding about what actually the distributed file system works, about the racks, nodes, blocks and meta-data.
For problem 2 and problem 3, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt about MapReduce. In these two problems, two real problems are provided for me to decide the outputs and inputs of the Mapper and Reducer. Through this, I have a deep understanding about how the process of MapReduce works.

The first problem requires me to use what I learned in lab 1 and I believe it is a good chance for to review as it is always hard to remember what I did in lab homework.

It's like we are spending time to build more strong backgrounds about distributed file systems and form intuition about what is cloud computing and how we can deploy a clud computing systems. From this homework, I recall all the concepts itroduced last week and also pose me some questions that worth thinking twice. To conclude, I would like to rate it 5 starts due to its help. 
",5
569,fl18,hw4,020E9BZ,"I think this homework is fine. As usual I would not give homeworks with a lot of written questions a high score, so I gave this one a five. I also cooperated with someone else on this homework, so influenced by this factor I would say I like this homework overall.",5
570,fl18,hw4,05A511Z,"This homework is the first time we get to do some code work and I think it did a good job by introducing us to the coding based on something we have done in the lab previously, so we won't be too lost. One thing I would suggest is if we learn more about how to implement the partitioners in the lecture this homework may be even more clear.",5
571,fl18,hw4,08BF6BZ,"This time, I really like this homework. Because this time ,it directly teaches how to use Hadoop to finish all of the work. It combines the knowledge before and then I put in practice, which not only helps me know better about the knowledge but know how to realize it. ",5
572,fl18,hw4,0CE6FFZ,"I really like homework 4 so far, and it is one of my favorite homework so far. Homework 4 really does a good job at reviewing the stuff I was taught in the lecture and lab. I was having a hard time understanding the materials and concepts, and after finishing this homework, I feel much better about the content. The TA's are very helpful. The coding part is easy, and it helps me to visualize the structures of the mapreduce job. I'm satisfied with this homework overall.
",5
573,fl18,hw4,1BA8DEZ,"As the course goes deeper, the homework assignment is more and more difficult. My foundation in Java is not very good. I think it takes me almost two days to finish this assignment. I should read the slides carefully, where a lot of useful information can be found. I hope I could perfom better in the following assignments.
",5
574,fl18,hw4,1C39DFZ,"Actually it's a good assignment, it trains me the ability to use java, and I have the experience to do something meaningful, however, the instruction is kind of simple for a beginner like me, so I think it will be more friendly if more specific details can be provided. Also, I thinks improvement can be made for the reply speed in Piazza. Anyway, it’s a good assignment.
",5
575,fl18,hw4,1EBAB4Z,"This homework was helpful in solidifying my understanding of how a map reduce program works. I am becoming more familiar with the layout of the Hadoop cluster. And it is becoming easier to navigate the file systems and running the programs. I also saw how to use and the benefits of the tool runner and the partition. 
",5
576,fl18,hw4,20F7A7Z,"I think this homework was good. It was nice that it allowed us to learn some useful tools that should help in the future, such as being able to pass arguments with toolrunner, while we also had to develop our own mapreduce programs. With the last couple questions, it was a good mix of implementation and conceptual work.
",5
577,fl18,hw4,268B8EZ,"In this homework, I practiced skill to code in hadoop. After I finished this homework, I am more familiar with the skill to debug in Eclipse and how to code. It's very helpful. I also learned how to use toolrunners and how to configure. It's also pretty interesting.
",5
578,fl18,hw4,2EA398Z,"I think after having a more conprehensive understanding of the hadoop structure and its syntax, hw4 is quite doable for me. It gives me a sense of accomplishment when I followed the codes on the slides and completed my own first concrete Hadoop project. I think it is a real fun! But I also know that this is just a simple implementation. I will keep on learning!
",5
579,fl18,hw4,720CA7Z,"This homework is much harder than last 3, and it took a lot of time. Because there are lots of configurations to set. Meanwhile, I had to go over the previous slides and labs to make sure I was doing the right thing each step. But I think it is a good homework for me to get familiar with hadoop.
",5
580,fl18,hw4,7CE170Z,"This homework reviews architecture of map function, partioner, distributed cache, and reduce function. Its main method focus on programming issues. We first modify mapper class and reducer class to make lowercases scene. Then, we use toolrunner to input parameter from commandline. Implementation of individual partitioner class make us understand the procedure of programming. It is also fine to discuss improvement of sentiment analysis.
",5
581,fl18,hw4,863B82Z,"Overall this was an enjoyable set of homework questions. While it was shorter than the other ones, I feel that by actually writing code for map reduce, as well as the partitioner, I learned a reasonable amount. While on one hand, I wish we were simply given more comprehensive tests to help determine if our partitoner was working, having to come up with our own was also a good learning experience. My partner blew up his setup, which took a long amount of time to troubleshoot, but other than that it was a good set of HW.
",5
582,fl18,hw4,9466D0Z,"For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lab and from textbook about using tool runner for map reduce job. 
	For problem 2, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in class about the knowledge of partitioner. 
	Through these two questions, I am not only apply the knowledge about map reduce, but also the knowledge about coding. Based on this, I grow an deep understanding about the job execution of map reduce.

",5
583,fl18,hw4,9E9721Z,"This homework is really really difficult. The partitioner code part is extremely difficult because there are no example of slides. I have to read a lot of materials to do this  
The mapper and reducer is much easier because of the example in the slides. In general, this homework help me learn a lot because I need to learn lots of materials.",5
584,fl18,hw4,A3354FZ,"HW4 Extra problem

(1) Second problem is really good review for learning lecture notes. I am really enjoy this problem, we can get a deep learning  of the properties of partitioner and use the practice to consolidate what I have learned.



",5
585,fl18,hw4,A3A0C4Z,"I give this homework assignment 5 stars. Compared to the other assignments, this assignment took a much more hands on approach, in the sense that it actually made us write some code. The problems to be solved were less based in the theory of the mapreduce framework, and more based in practical application. Overall, this assignment was a good introduction to getting your hands dirty in writing mapreduce programs in java.
",5
586,fl18,hw4,A989D3Z,"I'm very happy with this week's homework, it's the first time that I write codes to conduct a mapreduce program and during the process I learnt a lot about how to use toolrunner to pass parameters and execute different logic wriiten in mapper configuration. Based on what we learnt from class, I deepen my insight of mapreduce job by writing code and I this it is very helpful to write this homework as a beginning of this class and I'm looking forward to learn more from next week's classes.

587,fl18,hw4,BBFB04Z,"Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW4 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR job running and configuration. And HW4 give me comprehensive understand of MR jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW4 very well.
",5
588,fl18,hw4,BF7834Z,"In this homework, we try to write out own code to better understand mapreduce problem. I think it is a good way for us to understand the mappper, the driver and the reduce better. By writing our own code, I can understand the precedures better.
",5
589,fl18,hw4,D8E4A3Z,"I think this is a very meaningful homework. Before doing this homework, I do not have a very clear idea about what is distributed catch and configuration. After doing this homework, at least I know how to implement them. However, I think the homework is a little diffcult for the people who use hadoop for the first time. Especially, there is no example about these implementation. I think the homework can be better if the ta can provide us some more exmaples. But overall, it is a very good and useful homework. ",5
590,fl18,hw4,EC9623Z,"This homework teaches me how to run the MapReduce in a real word, which makes me excited because I finally get some practical experiences. Moreover, this homework introduced some tricks that I can use to test my code and implement it faster by local testing and configure some key parameters using command line. However, I also have some advice to this class are that instructors can provide us more examples and code snippests to illustrate the concepts in the lectures. I think it is always a good method to explain code using real word instances.",5
591,fl18,hw4,F52E65Z,"This homework is very godd, this is really helps me on programming and helps me to understand what I have learned from the school better, I really think this is a good homework. I think we should more work like this, but I don't know what comment you code means.
",5
592,fl18,hw4,F6ADB8Z,"This homework is pretty hard for me. Problem 1 may took 2 to 3 hours to finish. It introduces the ToolRunner so that we are able to pass stuff into driver using command line. For problem 2, the instruction seems a little ambiguous. So it took me pretty long to finally understand what to do. Also for the test part we need to firstly don't use distributed cache to pass the test, then change it to distributed cache to fullfill the requirements. 
",5
593,fl18,hw4,FFBEA4Z,"I thought that this homework was very good.  The concepts covered were interesting, and I enjoyed applying what I’ve learned about map reduce to perform an actual task such as a sentiment analysis.  I learned more about how toolrunner works than I would’ve been able to in lecture, and I found the implementation of average word length and sentiment analysis to be very helpful to my understanding of the concepts.
",5
594,fl18,hw5,05A511Z,"I think this homework introduces us further into implementing the mapreduce program and the concept of comparator, so its material is good. Also, it is less ambiguous than previous homework that involves only text because of its focus on coding. Overall, I like this homework and hope that future homework will resemble this one.",5
595,fl18,hw5,11A4CEZ,"This homework is way better than the last one. At least that's how it makes me feel.
It still consumes me tons of time but at least I am able to always see my progress.
Knowing that fact that I would eventually make it is really important to me. Hopefully, 
we don't get to work on another homework that is as hard as last one. Just kidding, 
I want more!
",5
596,fl18,hw5,1BA8DEZ,"hw5 is a good exercise for me to finish. Problem one is fundamental to teach us how to write a relatively complete function. Problem two is about secondary sort. It guides me through the textbook and slides to read the concerning parts to get the information to finish the problem. It helps me to get the key point of global sort and secondary sort. It is a very good exercise for me.
",5
597,fl18,hw5,1C39DFZ,"Actually, hw5 is a good one, it gives specific instructions to us, but we still need to do something by ourselves, that’s a good strategy to teach us, the teacher gives us a direction and some guidance, then for the rest, we have to figure them out with our efforts. My suggestion is: if the problem description can be more detailed, it would be easier for us, because we can save a lot of time in Piazza.
",5
598,fl18,hw5,268B8EZ,"In this homework, I felt a little bit stressful. There are so many coding work to do in this homework. And as for myself, it took me three days to finish this. I believe there will be more homework in the future. Without fully understanding what professor taught in the class, I can hardly finish all these stuff.
",5
599,fl18,hw5,502392Z,"I mainly worked on implementing the inverted index map reduce job. This was a good exercise in a new input format and non integer values in key value pairs. I ran into difficulty running the job because I was trying to build it from .java files when I actually needed to build it out the stubs package. 
",5
600,fl18,hw5,863B82Z,"I really enjoyed this set of hw. I felt that the balance between written response and coding was very solid. We ran into a few issues getting the jar file to run on hadoop, but at the end we realized that it was our problem. The issues was that we had to pass the relative path to the main method into the arguments, and we butchered it. Overall I think it was a good learning experience. I feel that the passage on InputSplit was a bit confusing, and we ended up having to figure out for ourselves what the solution was. 
",5
601,fl18,hw5,9466D0Z,"For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, 2 and 3, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lab about using java to do the mapreduce. Question 1 is not difficult, it only needs to count the occurance of full. Question 2 is a little complexed. It asks us to do some analysis about secondary sort that we do in lab first, and then to do some changes and improve. This is helpful, since we do not know how to do the lab, but also know why we do this.
For question 3, it is not that much difficult, but it is takes time for me to figure out the word meaning for the question.

",5
602,fl18,hw5,9E9721Z,"This time the homework is much more than before. We must spend more time to deal with them. But it is good to have the experience of solving it.
The 1st problem is easy to solve, we just need to change the code from WordCount a little to do it.
The 2nd and 3rd problems is a little bit difficult but finally we finish it.

Although we struggle them for a long time as before, but we really get a lot of usful knowledge. However, i dont like the question b of problem 2 and question a of problem 3 since the corresponding context did not appear in our note and lecuture, but in the related materials and that really confused us for a while since it just jumped out and tell us you should use keyvaluetextinputformat even if we dont know what it is. i really hope the homework can be more specific match the content we learned in lecture and lab so that it helps us strength the understanding of them as this is the meaning and function of homework.

Problem 1 asked us to use the code from Lab 5 to complete it, and I had a working copy of the Lab, so modifying that code took almost no time. Also, part 2 could be completed very quickly as it was conceptual from part 1. Loved this homework, favorite one of the semester.

641,fl18,hw7,05A511Z,"This homework is also a good one. It seems with several past homework focusing on coding, this homework starts to shift back to conceptual questions. One thing I would suggest is that because the co-occurrence recommendation is about two jobs, and we only get to implement, it would be better if we get the practice implementing both jobs (and therefore maybe the percentage of the first question should be larger).",5

I feel like I understand the cosine similarity algorithms (and their variants) well after computing the Mapper and Reducer inputs and outputs for the third question. The second question also reinforced the advantages and disadvantages between each of the similarity measures.

644,fl18,hw7,1B3313Z,"i am very happy with this assignment. We started early and finished it on Saturday. And my partner and I shared all the work. We each did 50 percent of it. It was a good experience learning collaborative filtering. I wish we can work like this in the following assignments. I like this assignment a lot and really enjoyed it!
",5
645,fl18,hw7,1BA8DEZ,"Homework seven is a good exercise. In this assignment, I review what I have learnt in the recommendation system. I have grasped basic concepts about Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and Pearson similarity. Besides, I learnt the trade off between pairs implementation and stripes implementation. It is a good exercise.
",5
646,fl18,hw7,1C39DFZ,"HW7 is not as good as the homework before, because the coding part is not what we learned in class, i.e. I expected to find the similar users and predict the ratings for each user, although the problem 2 is related with the topic, but we don't need to actually operate anything. I hope the homework could still be stick with the content in class.

647,fl18,hw7,1EBAB4Z,"This homework expanded my understading on how co-occurance works. It was helpful to get a practical implementation of the toy example from the lab(even though we are doing a differnt thing here in the homework the idea is the same). It was also helpful in demonstrating the need for collabrative filtering and the example demonstrated well how that works. Overall it was a good homework.
",5
648,fl18,hw7,20F7A7Z,"I liked this homework a good amount. I really enjoyed the more theoretical aspects of the homework, such as the math portion in problem 2. I think that kind of critical analysis is really important in this kind of work where the efiiciency of your solution is very important due to the size of the data being analyzed.
",5
649,fl18,hw7,254574Z,"I really liked this homework, and really any homework that involves Shakespeare data, because I think it's really cool information to have. My partner and I did have some clarification questions, but not as many as in some previous homeworks. I think this really helped me understand the differences between stripes and pairs, as well making those concepts generic enough for me that I can separate them in my mind from job one in item recommendation.
",5
650,fl18,hw7,268B8EZ,"In this homework, I finished my code and do the homework all by myself. After that, I checked my answer with another student and we submit in group. It surprised me that it's such a easy way to submit a file shared by both of us. In this homework, I reviewed how to implement collabrative filter and finished the word co-occurance coding work in hadoop. It's a very interesting process.
",5
651,fl18,hw7,502392Z,"Implementing the pairs map reduce job wasn't overly difficult after doing it on paper in class. the major concern that i did not run into in the paper example but that i did run into in the java implementation is how bigrams are formed between two lines if at all. I didnt know a good way to address this in my code but maybe map reduce does it for me

652,fl18,hw7,7086E1Z,"In the Seventh homework we learned to implement simple MapReduce job to compute word co-occurrence which is useful in Recommendation System. However, the approach we use has many drawbacks so I am looking forward to improve it in the future. Also I reviewed the similarity measures in collaborative filtering and compare the pros and cons of those measures.
",5
653,fl18,hw7,720CA7Z,"homework 7 is kind of easy. And we are given two weeks to do it which is great. The content is closely related to the knowledge we have been taught. But I am still kind of confused about whether I should leave out the movies that one has rated and another has not when calculating the cosine similarity.
",5
654,fl18,hw7,7CE170Z,"In assignment 7, we talked about communication cost, memory requrement, advantages and disadvantages of Jaccard, implementation and analysis by using cosine. What impress me is the communication cost because we will use it in a actual problem. Also, we used cosine analysis in collaborative filtering. It makes me familiar with the mapreduce flow of the algorithm. The coding part is easy but the analysis of the idea is not easy to figuer out. we deliberated and made comparsion with slides.

",5
656,fl18,hw7,8D606DZ,"I like this homework. It is very nice. It doesn't require too much implementation. The code can be easily modified based on word-co and the slides. I made a small bug, but thant to my partner it is easily solved. I wish the rubic for problem 2 and 3 are not too harsh. These paper-pencil question can be tricky sometime. We should get the credits if we understand the material. Missing the points should be allowed.",5
657,fl18,hw7,9466D0Z,"For these three problems, I like all these questions. 
For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lab about using java to do the mapreduce about co-occurrence. Question 1 is not difficult, since we have already learn the persocode. 
For problem 2, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lecture about similarity. In this case, we need to understand about the similarity, not only remember how to calculate the similarity.
For problem 3, the question asks us to think about another approach about collaborative filtering, which is item-item-co-occurrence. This is the application based on what we have learnt in class, which is user-user-co-occurrence. I think this problem is quite useful.

658,fl18,hw7,AAF8D6Z,"this time i feel comfortable and think this assignment is useful to help to better understand the matarial of the course.

659,fl18,hw7,B68C78Z,"There are 3 problems in homework 7 and I think this homework is very great! It’s different from the previous homework as this time it only requires us to write a little code. And I think it’s good because we are familiar with writing codes to do map reduce job now and do not need more additional practice. And this time we have a lot of problems to analyze or calculate, which are closely related to what we learned in class. I think theses are very helpful.

660,fl18,hw7,BBFB04Z,"Homework is well designed for further understanding the meterial in lecture. Mixing the problem from lecture, textbook and lab is really helpful to me to understand the content learned from class. HW7 gives me alot chance to practice the hadoop skill and improve my understand of hadoop MR job running and configuration. HW7 connected to real world application, which is quite exciting to work with. And HW7 give me comprehensive understand of co-occurence jobs. Overall, I enjoy HW7 very well.

I think it is a good homework to review the knowledge that we have learned.
",5
662,fl18,hw7,C3C00CZ,"I liked how in this homework we got more into the theory of how these things work. I liked the last problem in part b, because it cemented my understanding of how to calculate the similarity measures. Comparing and contrasting the methods was also an interesting and enlightening exercise. I like assignments where we think about the benefits and drawbacks of certain methods.

The sample codes are really helpful to the problem 1, which is the coding part. and the second problem can be easily solved refer to the previous lab and instruction.

664,fl18,hw7,EC9623Z,"I'd like to give this hw a 5 star because this homework gives me practival experience to build a complete mapreduce job that can be applied in the real word, which is the most useful thing for this class from my point of view. Moreover, I think this homework can be promoted by integrating more subtle sections that explains more details and give students intuitives about what's going on behind the scenc.
",5
665,fl18,hw7,F52E65Z,"Problem 1 is a good problem, when I first see this problem, I was confused because we always need 2 jobs to achieve the goals we wan, but there are only 2 files in the directory. Then I figured out that there is only one user and we can ignore the job1, this is really a good problem.
The other 2 questions are also good, help me to understand the similarity and co-occurrence better.

666,fl18,hw8,05A511Z,"I think this homework introduces us to fast-pace mapreduce using pig and spark, so it's very practical. The thing I don't quite like about pig and spark is just that it doesn't have a progress report about the job. In java mapreduce it will say things like ""map 25%"" but we don't have that in pig or spark.",5

end faster. To make life even harder, we are going to have a midterm ten days later. I don't know if I can handle it at that time.
Hopefully, things could get better.
",5
668,fl18,hw8,18EC32Z,"I thought that this homework was good for reinforcing pig and spark. Doing ETL with Spark was interesting for me as I thought it was really cool how we could do the entire process in just a few lines of code. Essentially, we just needed to import the helper methods from the provided pyspark file, create the RDDs and map them to ""account_number:model"" strings in one line, and then save them to the output directory in another line.
",5
669,fl18,hw8,1B3313Z,"I really like how this assignment is about both pig and spark. I enjoyed this very much because I did the labs well and I was able to implement and elevate my knowledge from labs in the homework.

670,fl18,hw8,1C39DFZ,"HW8 is a good assignment, it combines the PIG and Spark together, and it improves my understanding of the PIG and Spark operations, I really like this homework, but I think it still need some improvement on the Piazza, I mean the respond spped is too slow, I didn't receive any feedback even after a day, that's the only drawback, thanks!
",5
671,fl18,hw8,1EBAB4Z,"This homework was more practical and I liked that. It demonstrated how we can use map-reduce,pig,scala etc. to solve real world problems. It helped me work through how pig commands. Working on that problem I understood the need for a local data set sample to run and debug the script before using the huge file in HDFS. Overall, it was a good and practical homework. 


",5
672,fl18,hw8,268B8EZ,"In this lab, there seems to be so many problems. But I found the first three are very similar once you understand how to implement a pig program. The first one is a little bit tricky and took me a lot of time to finish it. The process doing this homework is not very pleasant. When I did first program. There came a lot of problems since I didn't finish my lab7 firstly. Since then, I decided to read the preparations for a homework. It's very helpful.
",5
673,fl18,hw8,502392Z,"Problems one, two and three were good exercises in basic pig data manipulation and the pig development process. The only major issue I had was caused by confusion surrounding the inexplicit types in pig. I spent many hours trying to figure out why my click through rate calculation was not providing accurate results. First I had to learn more about the data set. I finally realized I was doing integer division and that was the error. 
",5
674,fl18,hw8,5C67BEZ,"HW8 was good. Pig is really good. I know spark will be even better. Pig is so much easier then having to write and compile Java code over and over. And it's faster. Makes you wonder, why did we have to write jave code in the first place. Or at least there isn't a a good reason to spend so much time implementing jobs with java. Wrote so many lines of repetitive useless code in Java.

They improve a lot compare to MapReduce jobs have, most importantly, they are faster, especially spark.

676,fl18,hw8,70BB65Z,"This homework is killing me. Why am I saying that? Because things starting from
this week is totally different from before. We used to using java to make
map-reduce jobs, and I am getting used to it. But now, we are switching to
something that is more high-leveled. It is good, but we need to study another
type of language. It costs me 5 hours to get lab7 right. But that is totally
not enough for doing this homework. The logic of the mission the homework requ
ires us to do, is simple. But, I just cannot get the script right! It really
lacks helping documents. I stuck on the same stupid problem for like, 5 hours.
This is really true, not kidding. Finally, I use a very stupid way, to get
things working. This is really bad. Next homework is already out, should be
something about spark. Ah. I'm not feeling good.

678,fl18,hw8,7CE170Z,"In homework8, we deeply discussed implementation of pig scripts. The bacis usage of FOREACH GENERATE sentence and its extension are included in the homework. Those concepts are included in pig2 slides which we need to review. Pig operations are followed by many parts, through FOREACH GENERATE is popular. Deeply understanding how does each column and head of attributes act in the FOREACH GENERATE is also important. PyPark is special one since we did add helper functions in it to help its .xml files structures and then we used its syntax to run the scripts.

685,fl18,hw8,CD4772Z,"This homework requires a lot of reviews for different materials including PIG and Spark, especially since the Pig lab was a while ago and I didn't remember anything about the syntax. The homework was a little difficult since it involved materials that weren't taught so I needed to go through the slides a few times to understand. However, there's not much writing required in this one which is nice since normally the conceptual ones also take me a while to write down the answers.

710,fl18,hwM,13F585Z,"Homework M was a really cool assignment! For question #1, we found writing the Spark code to be a breeze considering most of it was given to us in a previous lab. We just replaced the teleportation constants for both parts a and b. Problem #2 was another small modification of this code. This took a while to run but was similar conceptually. Problem #3 was an interesting problem that will help our conceptual understanding for our final project, so I enjoyed it. Great way to end our semester!

For Problem 1, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lab about using pyspark to count the number by requirement. Question 1 is not difficult.
For problem 2, the question asks us to apply what we have learnt in lecture and lab about pyspark and RDD to do more sophistacted requirment. THis one is more difficult than problem 1.
For problem 3, the question asks us to knowledge that we have learnt in lecture about running a spark job locally. THis one is useful, since we need to understand the process.

Homework 2 is about basic set-ups about HFDS in VM and basic concepts of the DFS system as well as Mapreduce process. So for problem 1, Although it is suitable for the start, I think it is too easy to work on. It is not supposed to be difficult for problems like these, but I think it will be better if we more questions on problem 1. Because the goal here is to get familiar with hadoop commands. For non-command questions, I think it can be a good way if we have multiple choice questions.

So, from this time I will try to rate the homework in 3 aspects, which can be a good idea statistically. In terms of time consumption, I will give 2 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 4 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 2 stars.

728,fl18,hw2,A3A0C4Z,"Homework 2 was a good introduction to understanding the way files are stored in the hadoop filesystem. I think having us copy and paste the exact commands we used to do the various specified tasks is a good way to have us not only understand how things work under the hood, but also to gain some practical experience of executing commands that directly interface with the hadoop file system. Also, with respect to mapReduce, manually computing the process that a MapReduce program uses is a really good way to understand how exactly a mapreduce program works. It really isn't that trivial of a process, and is different from the way a similar problem would be solved using regular computing.

We also explored how to use Apache Spark to do ETL. ",na
781,fl18,hw8,13F585Z,"Homework 8 was a really cool assignment. For questions #1 adn #2, we had no problem writing the pig code to get the necessary information. Question #3 took us longer but once we understood the syntax it was a breeze. Question #4 was really fun because we got to use spark, which seems very powerful. Question #5 was conceptual, so it was much simpler than the previous four.

782,fl18,hw8,20F7A7Z,"I liked this homwork a lot. I think along with the labs, it taught us a lot about how the different languages work. The related lecutures had good theory related to the different languages and how their runtime systems behave differently. I'm not really sure why we used pig at all because that was incredibly tedious and slow.
",na
783,fl18,hw8,25795FZ,"HW 8 is an exercise about pig and spark. I think these are helpful because they are really the contemporary tools that we use now. However, I think if there is a comprehensive instruction, it would be easier to follow the process. It is always a good idea to have a good documentation of the tools we use step by step. Also, I think we should work a little more on spark and pig compared to hadoop. Because some of the previous assignments on hadoop are similar and spark and pig are quite important.

At last it is the rating for this assignment. For time consumption, I will give 4 stars. In terms of helpfulness, I will give 4 stars. In terms of difficulty, I will give 4 stars. In terms of clarity of instruction, I will give 3 stars.

In this sense, this homework seemd pretty relevant for real-world applications. A problem that I had with the homework is that it wasn't clear whether or not we were supposed to pre-process the data (delete duplicate records), and you get different answers depending on whether or not you do this. Also, many of the instructions were a bit unclear.

",1
810,fl19,hw3,5B1F10,"I disliked this assignment a lot because I felt that many of the questions were extremely unclear in their wording and general structure. For example, problem two on skew took a textbook problem that made a lot of sense and transformed it into an extremely confusing, poorly worded question that in fact used many of the terms we were suggested not to use such as 'Reduce task.' Additionally, we did not actually discuss Combiners or skew in class until after the homework assignment was due. Also, problem three on Job Execution was even more confusing as we did not discuss YARN at all in class, and the two sub-questions were extremely poorly phrased so that they did not correlate with any of the actual material. For example, asking us to describe job execution using the YARN scheduler was an awful question as the textbook offers three different methods of job execution, but allegedely the answer desired had nothing to do with those methods. I was surprised by how poorly worded these questions were and how unnecessarily unclear they were, and I hope future homeworks are more clear and accurate about what answers they seek so as to not cause unnecessary, unproductive confusion.

811,fl19,hw3,5FC843,"Overall I did not like this hw assignment. It was very technical and theoretical. I know that its important to know these concepts but I feel like I learn better by coding or applying. I dont know if its possible to understand scheduling and job execution by practicing since your computer just handles it. Overall I wish HW was just graded for participation not accuracy but we still get feedback so we learn. I liked the first problem because we actually got to run commands and think about how to count all the key value pairs. It felt more like a puzzle and we didn't really need to refer to the textbook. The third problem was my least favorite since it was laborious to describe the technical details. This was the most difficult hw thus far and it caught me off guard.

812,fl19,hw3,DA80EA,"I really enjoyed this homework assignment. I felt like this was the first time I actually got my hands into the weeds of how cloud computing actually worked. I found it particularly challenging to explain YARN effectively. It didn't really make a lot of sense to me but I will work on understanding it better. I did feel like this homework assignment was a bit of regurgitation of slides/stuff in the textbook, which is fine but I am unsure if i actually know what's going on. (I spent a lot of this assignment paraphrasing stuff from slides etc.

813,fl19,hw5,CA1572,"I dislike the similarity calculation very much. No matter if one understands the concept very well, it is just kind of laborious work with fractions. It can be easily adjusted so that the intermediate results are not fractions.

In addition, I'm confused what is a formal proof for problem 3(a). It's just too obvious that we can replace normalized values with the formula how you normalize them. I even want to write ""by definition they are the same"".

I learned that when you use string.split(), it can return an empty string. It produces an extremely long record for """" if I don't check this thing.",1

I think one of the biggest issues I had was with problem 2.a.ii, where the question was poorly written to start and furthermore seems to have forgotten that in-place O(n log n) sorting exists. Furthermore, question 3, where you had to do a map reduce job by hand was incredibly tedious. The entire reason we have computers is so that we don't have to do these sorts of tedious tasks. Overall, this was my second to least homework so far, after homework 1.

I spent too much time trying to make my code run on hadoop, while it ran perfectly fine on eclipse. Therefore we could not go on and work on part of problem 2.

819,fl19,hw9,A204CB,"I feel I am going to crash. Three meetings in three days, each of them needs my reseach results. And then I found I still have a homework to do and without understanding of some part of it. I just answered some of them. In total I feel painful for cloud computing homeworks. One reason is that there are too many things to look at. Usually 50 to 80 pages of slides, one lab and one homework each week, and two books I do not have time to scan. I am not sure if I can really remember anything for the course.

820,fl19,hw1,3E9288,"I do not like the third problem. Although it gave me some insight about the comparison of the data-based approach and learning general rules from a smaller data set,
I did't find it very helpful for us to answer all the questions and I am still confused about the specific pros and cons of this approach, and how we should use it.

The most suprising thing I learned from this homework is how the threshold we set could affect the result in problem 2. We must be very careful when building a new
model in order to make the results we get truly meaningful rather than just some random noise.
",2
821,fl19,hw2,1F6D48,"I did not really like the first question much. I felt that it was really long and rather redundant. Basically, the main idea is that Hadoop is for big data. It kept asking for disadavantages that were not listed in Hadoop the Definitive Guide. I felt like I was digging in my pockets to not sound redunant. It seems like it was ll around that idea and could have been a shorter question. However, I did enjoy the MapReduce problems. I like when we are actually doing what the computer does behind the scenes. It is good to understand what the code is doing and not just writing it. Makes for better programmers.

822,fl19,hw2,5FC843,"Overall, I learned a lot from this assignment because it made me reference the textbook to solve problems. The hints told us what pages to look and rereading these sections reinforced my memory. Drawing my own diagram made me recall what professor neuman discussed in lecture. The map reduce problems made me refer to the slides and also recall what I learned in parallel and concurrent programming. The problems were short, simple and made me learn.

I had to google a lot and most of the information provided on the hadoop website was obscure and difficult to understand.The questions seemed to be too open ended and it was hard to pinpoint just exactly what is being asked. I was surprised by how ambiguous this homework was. I learned about the different daemons of YARN and what it does in MapReduce. I also learned about what skew meant in MapReduce. 
",2
824,fl19,hw3,58093E,"I think that homework 3 was too challenging, and that YARN is not a concept that we actually need to understand in order to be good at using Hadoop. I realize it's always good to know how things work behind the scenes but I don't think that this particular problem set was a good way to test our knowledge on it. Perhaps something like ""expain in your own words what YARN does"" would have been better or more appropriate.
",2
825,fl19,hw3,E2A5A7,"In this assignment, I liked that we had to do a bit of self study in order to come up with the answers. For example, question 2 on skew required us to really read and learn from the textbook, since (I don't believe) it was talked about in class. I disliked the last part of the last question on data locality optimization because I felt like it was pretty difficult to search for the concrete answer in the readings.

The most important thing I learned is where data is stored during the map reduce process. This will help provide insight on map reduce job failures, because they might be able to be explained by where memory might have been lost during the job.

I was surprised that results from the lab played an integral part in answering the hw questions. 

Going off on the above point, if I had to do this homework again I would keep more detailed notes from lab2 so that I could have directly referred to them.

I really did not like this assignment at all and it should be radically changed for next semester / next year. I think the surprising / hard thing was the level of flexibility needed for this assignment especially with the partitioner file reading and the many ways to actually implement without a standardized way that the TA's could know and be prepared to answer questions on that one format. I went to TA hours on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday trying to finish it, and I still do not think I did too well on it.

The part I disliked most, however, was the part of question 2 where we were asked to draw the DAG. I feel that there were not enough examples of this in the notes, and the instructions were very unclear.

But, much of my issue with the length of the assignment stems from the content within it. This section of material on SPARK was not taught very effectively so that I felt extremely unprepared to complete the coding portions of the homework (essentially most of the homework). The assignment was somewhat successful in helping me better understand how to work with RDDs, but I wish the material was taught more effectively with a greater focus on practical implementation and coding.If I could start over again I would teach myself SPARK as the slides, lectures, and lab section was largely unhelpful.

841,fl19,hw9,D4CDC9,"This is probably the second to worst homework after homework 1. The first problem was fine as was most of problem 2. The graph for two was challenging since we have not made them ourselves in class, so it was hard to know what Neuman wanted. Problem 3 was annoying since the definition for ""result"" is super unclear, and the result is never really stored unless you specifically ask Spark to store it, so the question doesn't really make sense. Question 4 was plain awful. If you ask for which format is more efficient, you need to more clearly define each format as well as your basis for efficiency.
",2
842,fl19,hw1,1CE70A,"I like the first 3 questions of Q1 and Q2 of this assignment. Q1(a)(b)(c) ask about the 5 characteristics and can practice my understanding of big data. However, (d) and (e) are a little bit ambiguous and I dont really know what they are asking for. Q2 is also a very solid question where I can have clear logic and practice getting a formula for big data. In contrast, Q3 is more conceptual and the article doesnt really answer much of the question so I am also unsure what it is asking for.

When I am reading the article for Q3, it kind of surprises me that we are actually using a huge amount of unlabeled data to train model instead of generating natural language rules. This makes me keep thinking of how human beings learn language and comparing that to the machine. What leads to this difference? Is it possible to let machine think and learn as human? I think we are still on our way of exploring those questions.

This surprised me, as I usually don't enjoy doing those in a computer science class, but working through the problem and finding the correct answer was very satisfying. The part I disliked was the reading of the paper and the questions that accompanied it. I feel like there are better ways to learn about computer science subjects than what is essentially reading comprehension. I do, however, think that the knowledge I gained from the paper was the most important/interesting part of the assignment. I just don't find answering comprehension questions about research papers to be worthwhile.

846,fl19,hw1,2CF8F1,"I really enjoyed learning about Bonferroni's principle. It was a different way of conveying the idea that we have to be careful with data analytics becuase rare events become frequent in large data sets. I also really enjoyed analyzing the properties of the different data sets. I have been doing a lot of math and coding since starting down the data sciencey path and have not had a lot of time to think about 'real' setups and formulations in a concrete way like that. I was not crazy about the Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data Questions.I think they were good questions but thought the answers were a bit hard to glean from the article. Overall I enjoyed the assignment.

I would sit down with problem 2 and a piece of paper, and maybe review probability.

Also, it wasn't immediately obvious to me what ""MMDS book"" stood for. After completing the assignment, I found that both of these things were linked on the course calendar, which will be useful in the future. 

I think that the most important thing that I learned was about Bonferroni's Principle, since it seems like it provides useful context for the way people should search for features in datasets. ",3
850,fl19,hw1,5FC843,"Overall I like the first problem of the assignment. It made me practice what I have learned in class and forced me to look back at the slides to remind myself about the characteristics of big data. Problem 3 I did not like because the questions were more arbitrary. They weren't really asking about specific things covered in the text but about larger questions. They were more difficult to answer and personally did not feel like it helped me better understand the information. It was more regurgitating what the article said but did not improve comprehension. I think the most important thing I learned is the characteristics of big data because it taught me to consider what the data is being used for and what the advantages and disadvantages of it are. Problem 2 surprised me as it made me recall some of the work i did in my prior statistics class that I seemingly thought was irrelevant. It definitely pushed me to remember and improve on my math ability.

851,fl19,hw1,72AE9C," • What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?

	I like how we can review what we learned from class, and I like there are some calculation question because I like numbers
	
	I partially don’t like the first question because it doesn’t have a standard right or wrong question, it’s very flexible so I am worry about how that is going to affect my score

 • What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so? 

	I think that one of the most important things I learned is how to distinguish type of data, what does it mean to say big data applications and characteristics of data. I think this is vital because it helps me have this mind map that can quickly sort the data in the real world situation.


• What surprised you, and why? 
	I'm surprised that I have to read that essay for at least 4 times to get a hold of basic idea, and then 3 times more to extract information. I thought data and cloud computing concepts are supposed to be all about numbers and calculations, that's why I'm trapped in this essay and overwhelmed by all these concepts that I was trying to mind map.
	
	

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?First, I would definitely read the question 3 first and then go into reading the long essay, because that would be easier if I remember what I came for. Second, I would go for the textbook to check what it says about question 2.",3
852,fl19,hw1,8B09B7,"What I like about the assignment is that it helps me to have a deep and thorough understanding on the five characteristics of big data. By searching for statistics of the three different big datasets, I realized that the term “big” is not easy to obtain, and this process changes my view on big datasets. What I dislike about the assignment is that the article given in Problem 3 is not easy to read and extract explicit information from it. I agree that learning from outside reading is a good way to absorb various point of view. But there are so many other irrelevant information and I am wondering if it is worthy.
What surprised me mostly is the definition of “big” data. Previously I thought that the web data are all very huge because web is a huge platform for people worldwide providing information. But the characteristics of big data is not easy to be present at the same time. For example, we know that the amount of Wikipedia articles is large, but the average size of a single article is small. From this homework, I just learned that the definition of big data has multiple aspects and we need to know that different datasets have different aspects that denotes “big” in order to analyze them better.
",3
853,fl19,hw1,8D0920,"I liked the readings for this assignment because it gave me a good introduction to the topic. And the most important thing I learned was the principle of randomness over pure data, I thought it was significant for real-life applications. 
",3
854,fl19,hw1,CA1572,"I like the problem 3. I also tracked its references to read other articles related to this issue. The most interesting one is the original paper, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in Natural Sciences. However, I think it's better to contain some comments on this article to show what it's really about. I saw the author responded how others misinterpreted his ideas. Comparison may also highlight the meaningful part of the article.

The most important things I learned are about how mathematics influences research and how a huge amount of data changes the way people design algorithms. I think it's important to knows what roles the tools one uses play in his research. When he decides which tool to use, which direction he should research, which knowledge he should learn, he should have an inside map. Sometimes I'm confused if I should believe almost all life questions can be solved in mathematical way, like some AI scientists believe. I'm also confused what this data-oriented approaches will go to. Now I have some thoughts.",3

I like the problem 1. This problem is closely related to knowledges and concepts mentioned in class. This problem can help me review the related knowledge and consolidate my memory. However I don't like problem 3 very much. It seems hard to find answers to the questions in the articles. It takes me about 3 hours to finish it.

3. What surprised you, and why?
By reading the article ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data"", I'm surprised that even without elaborate artificial models, just by big data, many information can be acquired from the web. This shows the great power of big data.",3

I think the most important thing I learned is the characteristics of big data because problem 2 is only a statistic question and I did not have a good understanding of the article in problem 3. Bonferroni’s Principle suprised me because even in completely random datasets, you can expect particular events of interest to occur with a big enough dataset.

Through the assignment, I have found out some of my misunderstandings about the topics from lecture, and corrected them immediately. And, the assignment also help me to review the knowledge from lecture.

I think I would first review the slides and read the paper carefully first, since that might save me a lot more time. ",3
859,fl19,hw2,C2CB3B,"My biggest complaint with HW2 was with the text mentions in problem 1. The online copy of HTDG has no page numbers, so finding the mentioned pages in the hints (e.g. 43-45) was impossible. It would be much more helpful to have a very specific phrase at which to start reading. I thought the second and third problem are the most helpfl since they are more practical then the first. What surprised me was how the HTDG text had no page numbers, and that the passages mentioned were very vague/not helpful at times. If I could do the homework differently I would work mor eintensively one problem one and ask the professor or a TA whether or not the passage I was looking at for problem 1 was indeed the correct one to lookat.

However, lots of questions in this homework make me quite confused and do not know what to answer in order to get full credit. For example, the second question of problem 3 asks us to describe what is meant by a term, which really makes me confused.

The most important thing I learned is the Hadoop MapReduce job Execution.I learned the processes that run on master and worker nodes, and the storage location of data.

One thing I would have done differently is to use the grep command to find the word frequency for problem 1, as suggested by the TA.

I would start this assignment as soon as possible. Out of procrastination, I didn't completed my homework until now, which makes me stressed and frustrated. Also, I don't have time to go through the readings and doing the review.

866,fl19,hw3,F5A0C4,"I enjoyed learning about the various optimizations involved throughout the MapReduce process, including concepts such as parallelism and data locality optimization. One thing I disliked was the inconsistency in the terminology from the book and from class, including the mix-ups between general MapReduce systems and the specific Hadoop MapReduce system.

867,fl19,hw4,091CBC,"I liked this homework since we were actually able to write real code. Writing an actual mapper and reducer allowed me to finally put everything that I learned in class into perspective. I learned how a program takes in the data, parses it, and processes it. Comparing the differences in code before and after adding in the Toolrunner and setup functions to take in parameters was really cool. I wasn't too surprised by anything. I didn't like how slow, laggy, and difficult the VM was when I was using it. The assignment is cool, but the interface made it really not enjoyable unfortunately.

However, I think I also learned how to fix various problems when coding because not everyone will face same coding problems, so we have to fixed it by ourselves, by asking professor for help or google it by self. I think that is the most important part I learned from this assignment.  ",3
869,fl19,hw4,2CF8F1,"I thought the wording of questions 1a 1b and 1c was pretty confusing and could be made more clear.

870,fl19,hw4,2FA84D,"I really liked to code the logic for average length mapreduce program since it was pretty straightforward and I learned how mapreduce is working. 
Sentiment partitioner was also fun too. Reason why I liked those is because hw4 was the first coding assignment we have. I prefer coding to learning theory.
I think correctly setting up the mapper function is really important in mapreduce program since I have met some edge cases when using scanner instead of 
bufferedreader when reading string.

871,fl19,hw4,3986FF,"I would say I really prefer coding over doing other things, especially for this course because I believe coding could be a more solid training for the contents instead of just memorizing all these articles.

Before I actually working on this homework, I thought it would be easy since I have already know all the concept. However, when I actually started , problems and bugs just keep jumping out. While most bugs are just because of my carelessness, dealing with them is quite time and energy consuming. After this homework, I realized that I am still an elementary programmer, and there are lot of space of me to improve. 
What I don’t like about this assignment is that the instructions on the slides are too vague to understand the code and framework. I think we should add more comments on the code to understand the actual usage of each line of code. It is really not friendly for the beginner of Hadoop like me.",3

Many times just work on small problems, such as how to set the partitioner and let it work, how to let the code read the negative and positive file correctly, how to split the reducers. It is a bit annoying, since I know how it works, but do not know how to let it work. There is a big gap knowing how and doing how. Beyond that, I still have many questions about the structure itself. How does the partitioner pick the task just based on a few lines of code? How does the toolrunner works? Do we need to add toolrunner to do local debug? How to let eclipse running under debog mode, so I can see their output? There are a lot of confusing parts about this course. And I feel I just working on ""following the code of slices"".

877,fl19,hw4,C99808,"Overall I learned a lot from this homework. I enjoyed analyzing words and sentiment. I wish there was a little more guidance on this homework as it was our first time using eclipse doing this mapreduce stuff. I was surprised there was intially bugs in the homework problems. Most important thing I learned is that sentiment statistics can be quite misleading as it considers a lot of words to be neutral. If I were to restart this assigment, I would definitely start it much earlier. We started it late, and getting stuck on a bug was real stressful.

878,fl19,hw4,E2A5A7,"In this assignment, I liked that we actually had to code implementations of the things we learned about (toolRunner, wordcount mapreduce, etc.). I did not like that we also had a written portion along with the code, it felt pretty unnatural to describe what's happening in the code when we most likely need to understand what we're doing to code it in the first place.

The most important thing I learned was using toolRunner to be able to execute a mapreduce (with adjusting configuration parameters) from the command line. This makes running multiple configured map reduces easier.

I should take look at the regular expression since I haven’t use them a lot.

881,fl19,hw4,F887AA," This homework was definitely more challenging than the other ones. I liked the fact that we got to work with very technical parts of mapreduce, but once all the topics we discussed in class piled up, it started to confuse me. I had to spend quite some time trying to figure out which setup and initialization goes where. Of course, this was after I had to deal with the VM problem, because the metadata for eclipse somehow got messed up and had to restart from scratch (lab0). After reading through the instructions in the homework several times, it became clearer what I'm supposed to do, and from there I could fix the coding problems I had. 
Certainly, this homework took a lot longer than the other three, but was very worth it. The more time I spent on it, the better understanding of the MapReduce process and the details such as dirver, setup methods, partitioner, and distributed files.

While problem 2 and 3 were well formatted and helpful practice, I disliked the wording of the design questions of problem 1. Jumping from the book to lab and lecture slides,
 I felt I had little direction on knowing what was the correct answer for what the input format was. As a result of being unsure about the input format , I was stalled on working on my code for a very long time. I wish there was more overlap between the lab and the homework code, which would allow us to have a foundation to build our work off of and slides to reference. I did like, however, part b of problem 1, in which we are guided to what we expect the output to be and can think in the reverse direction.

I was definitely surprised and kind of caught off guard by the InputFormat question. Although we have been gaining practice with the key value input format, I felt the question was asking for a really specific answer I had no certainty about.

If I were to do this homework over again, I would have not read so in-depth into the different input formats that the book and the web present. When I sought clarity, it only provided more confusion and second guessing
",3
884,fl19,hw5,3986FF,"I would say this one was a little bit difficult for me. The last half was OK, but it seems that the coding part was a little bit of headache, as looking for the exact InputFormat was really a headache. However, after that, things got much easier, and I would conclude that this one was not hard. If I have prepared well, it would probably onl take me about 2.5 hours or more. 
",3
885,fl19,hw5,3E9288,"One of the important things I learned from this homework is how to use different type of input format
based on the form of the data available to us. Each line in this input file contains a line number and a line of text, 
separated by a tab. By using the KeyValueInputFormat, we can easily make the line number as the key and the text as
the value.

One thing I don't like about this assignment is the similarity part since I feel some of the questions are kind of ambiguous.
Like when we calculate Jaccard Similarity in the new way, we spent a lot of time to find out whether two user's ratings for
one element should be counted if there are different, but there is no clear explaination in either the slides or the textbook.
",3
886,fl19,hw5,5E922A,"The thing I liked least about this homework was the repeated calculation of the various different kinds of similarity metrics. I thought that this didn't really contribute anything to my understanding of the topic, and was tedious and error prone. 
I thought that the most useful part of this homework was learning how to access the name of an input file inside of the Mapper, and also how the different kinds of InputMappers worked, because that seems like it will be the most applicable to future projects.
",3
887,fl19,hw5,5FC843,"Overall i found this lab extremely interesting. It was mostly coding based so I preferred problem 1. Problem 2 was kind of annoying since it was more theoretical. It involved using mathematic similarity and it was kind of tedious. Problem 3 was also not coding based so i didn't like it as much. I learn more when we apply what we learned via code instead of theoretically. I think it cements it in my head more and therefore I am more likely to retain. Also I wish there was less write ups and more just coding.

888,fl19,hw5,70F7DE,"I feel that this homework assignment was little bit lengthy and difficult. The map reduce program we have learnt so far were little different from this inverted index problem.I had to spend lot of time understading the flow of the map reduce program. The other thing I have learnt from this homework is the various measures of similarity.The calculations had taken quit some time to solve but the over all concept was easy and simple.On the whole I find this assignment a little tougher especially the programming component compared to the previous homeworks.
",3
889,fl19,hw5,71A82E,"I do not like the coding part of the homework as there includes a package that was not mentioned in the class. We should have a library or appendex for introducing these libraries. It takes a huge amount time to find a pre-build funciton, which is meaningless.

890,fl19,hw5,8B09B7,"What I don’t like about this assignment is the inconsistence of similarity definition between the MMDS and slides. Since we used a different definition of similarity at the courses, I think we should distinguish it from the definition on the textbook. But in this assignment, there are no hints or tips to explain such difference and which one we should use. So I think this is a miss for instructors who is responsible for this assignment.
The most important thing I learned is that the similarity method is not a very good way to reveal the difference of users. Since there are many aspects that influence rating, so we can not use simple similarity measure (cosine, Jaccard) to represents the difference between users.",3
891,fl19,hw5,A204CB,"Hard time. I had an exam before this homework, so I have to use the late policy. For the code part, I feel confused about bugs. LongWritable, Textwritable, setinputformat, textinputformat, text.class, so many different function and types I do not know how they works. The idea it self is not hard, just find a line, use the method the book told you, convert them to text and write into result. The most annoying part is matching the type and class. Why are there so many types? Text is different from textinput, mapre.keyvalueinput is different from mapreduce.keyvalueinput, and cannot directly convert. InputSplit can be generated from input context, but it does not have the .getPath().getName, so I have to convert it to FileSplit. And Name from FileSplit is not text. Who can remember that? And I do not know how to get only the map input, and some times it is always map 100% reduce 0% without telling you what happened. And hadoop part acts slower than the eclipse part, do not know why. Exporting to .jar file works only if you did not set its entrance class, do not know why. Driver to Mapper part always have type matching problem, do not know why. And, after 80% of the code is finished, win10 update, and VMware cannot be opened anymore. I have to download a new version, restart computer for multiple times and get back to the cloudera. WTF. If I become a justice, I will rule that automatic update is illegal.

892,fl19,hw5,C99808,"Overall this homework was pretty easy. The similary score calculations were tedious and I thought they were unncessary. The coding problem was short but kinda tricky. I was surprised to learn the advantages and disadvantages of jaccard similary. Also I was surprised to learn that the cosine similary normalized is the same as a the person correlation. I never thought of that before. I enjoy learning what an inverted index is. Starting over I would have started the coding much sooner. I learned it's still very difficult to find which users are most similarusing the similary measures

Instead of spending a ton of time trying to get the code to work, I spent the time understanding the “why” behind the code working, which I feel like really enhanced my understanding of the Mapreduce job.

",3
894,fl19,hw5,CF1A87,"What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I don't like the second question. The reason is that the definition of cosine similarity on the slides is different from that on the MMDS textbook. I'm so confused about which is correct.

What surprised you, and why?
I'm surprised that the recommendation system theory is so simple and intuit. Before taking the class, I've heard about the recommendation system because it's so famous. However, the simplicity is beyond my thought. It surprises me.",3
895,fl19,hw5,E2A5A7,"In this assignment, I liked the coding section. I think it was
an interesting problem and i liked that we hadn't gone through
an exact example in class so we had to really think about it.
In this assignment, I did not like that there were some
discrepancies with calculating some of the similarities.
The textbook treats calculating jaccard similarity a bit different 
to how we wanted to treat it. 

The most important thing I learned from this homework assignment is the 
advantage and disadvantage of using the different types of similarity
calculations. For example, pearsson may produce the most intuitively 
correct results for movie ratings, but it is also the most memory 
intensive and slowest. It's important to know these tradeoffs because
cost / effectiveness is a realworld practical issue that always needs

896,fl19,hw6,1179BB,"This is homework is kind of confusing. Especially for the problem 1. The description is so obscure, and I do not know what to do after reading the description many times. The good thing about this homework is that it covers most of the materials that we learned in class and lab. From the homework, I learn about custom interface, secondary sort and collaborative filtering. ",3
897,fl19,hw6,2851E2,"I liked writing the entire mapreduce implementation from scratch for WordCo. I felt like it was a good way to get an even better understanding of mapreduce and custom writablecomparables. If I could start over on this assignment, I would have done the lab 4 and 5 optional parts before working on the code and writeup for homework 6, as it would have made the assignment go much smoother for me.
",3
898,fl19,hw6,58093E,"I wish this homework hadn't been so long. I don't think the concepts are as important as they seem to be emphasized in this class. I think what's more important is knowing how to code these mapreduce problems and how to use a partitioner for example. I always really enjoy the coding challenges and I look forward to the next assignment where we have three of them to work on. 
",3
899,fl19,hw6,5B1F10,"I was surprised by the fact that a simple change to the job configurations in the command line can entirely change how the output is sorted, as reflected in problem 2 part (c). If I could start this assignment over again, I would start earlier so as to give myself more time to process the material covered in it and better understand it. I liked the opportunity to code again in this assignment, but I disliked the reliance on Lab 5 in multiple of the questions.
",3
900,fl19,hw6,65E1AB,"I enjoyed the fact that this assignment forced me to learn how to implement collaborative filtering using MapReduce. I also liked how it forced me to understand the different comparators. However, I felt like a lot of the material was pretty repetitive with Lab 5. I think the most important thing I learned from this homework assignment was how to implement collaborative filtering using MapReduce.

",3
901,fl19,hw6,8BBD0C,"Overall i think one of the things that i disliked about the homework is that the second and third problems were confusing. I think the order of these two problems should have been switched for it to flow better. Additionally, i think the most useful thing i learned was how to calculated the item-item similarity. This was useful because it helped me truly understand how to execute that algorithm",3
902,fl19,hw6,8E054B,"I like Question3. Because it helps me have more comprehension about the Collaborative filtering in MapReduce. It really helps with coding. And I don't like Question1. Because the description here is not clear and if we do lab6 we will quickly finish Question1. We cannot have more exercise while finishing Question1
",3
903,fl19,hw6,C99808,"this homework wasn't so bad. I enjoyed doing the third problem 3 the most. I thought it was quite tedious but I learned alot from it. Problem 1 was also quite easy. Nothing in this homework really surprised me as it was straightforward. If I were to restart, I would have done this homework much sooner and learn it in earlier. The most annoying part of this homework was you had to change that int to longs in the sumreducer, was very annoying. should have just made the files all ints. maybe thats something marion can do to change this homework. 
",3
904,fl19,hw7,1179BB,"I think this homework is too much. The first question alone takes a lot of time. And it is really difficult to debug first question. Also, it would be better if the direction is clearer (more detailed). But I have to admit, I did learn a lot from the homework, and this homework is a good review for the content we have learned.
",3
905,fl19,hw7,32071B,"Homework 7 concerns about lab 6(top n list), definition and usage of combiner, and co-occurrence computation. Is the hardest one I have done. It take efforts to do the coding, read the log and do the calculation based on the log. For example, in lab 6, we spend a lot of time on the Practical Development rather than the coding. So, I find there are different ways to do the coding, like there are different ways to run two jobs in sequence. I would love to know which way of doing coding is the best, and why is the best. As for the problem 3, I feel like if the MapReduce Job log are talked about and showed in the class, I can solve the problem faster. Although this homework takes me more time, I do feel it's a good review and practice of what I learnt.",3
906,fl19,hw7,5B1F10,"I liked the opportunity to code in this assignment, as it advanced my understanding of the particular MapReduce algorithms and programs we discussed in class. Specifically, I felt implementing the word co-occurrence program for Problem 3 was useful to my understanding and made me more comfortable with that algorithm. However, I did not like the questions regarding communication cost, as it was confusing and hard to determine which counter statistics in the YARN Resource Manager were the correct ones to use, and the instructions on that subject were vague at best. If I could start over, I would start the assignment earlier so as to be able to dedicate more time to answering the written questions.
",3
907,fl19,hw7,5FC843,"Overall this hw was the best one we had. Problem 3 was a bit boring but problem 1 involved a bunch of coding and it was a continuation of the lab which I liked. Combiners are still confusing and I think we should talk about that more in class because the slides didnt have much on it. Other than that, I think that I have been given a better understanding of map reduce. That being said I'm ready to move on to different things other than map reduce. Like can we please cover other things in this class I dont feel like Im learning that much. I do like to code though.

908,fl19,hw7,65E1AB,"I disliked the instructions on this assignment. Although you could figure out what the instructions were asking for by looking at the example input and output, problem 3 for example never explicitly specified that the input should be read in as case-insensitive. If I could start this assignment over again, I would definitely schedule more time to it as it took me much longer than anticipated.

909,fl19,hw7,825E0B,"This homework problem 2 ask us to use the combiner and without combiner can really help us understand the processes of the map reduce job. And we can learn how to use YARN to get the information we need.
The problem 3 only have one method to get the result, we want to learn more about the strips.",3
910,fl19,hw7,8D0920,"What I enjoyed about this homework was the implementation side of things,
and the chance to put some of the things we learned about into actual code.
I would've liked more algorithmic thinking in some of the problems, because
one of the things I've disliked is that it seems like a lot of copy and paste
at points. I also think there's still some unclear wording, like in question 
3c, it asked ""what is the drawback,"" which is very ambigious and yet I'd
expect to get points off if I didn't answer this correctly. There are several
drawbacks to consider from an implementation standpoint, a mapreduce standpoint,
as well as an accuracy for natural language processing tasks. What interested me
was this last question because I enjoy nlp applications that significantly speed up
common tasks, like calculating ngrams.
",3
911,fl19,hw7,CA1572,"I'm very unsatisfied with the reference repo, because it is wrong. It uses rating as key to sort records but it's totally possible that two movies have the same rating. That implementation will keep forgetting the previous movies with the same ratings but only remembers the latest one. Although when ratings are all larger numbers it might rarely happen, especially for top movies, this implementation is still wrong. I strongly recommend mentioning that in the instructions or stopping referencing it.

I learned to use counter to read job statistics. That's something new to look at.",3
912,fl19,hw7,CF1A87,"For the first question,
I like the last question best because it helps me understand what the word co-occurrence is. This question also compares the ""pairs"" method and the ""stripes"" method.

For the last question,
If I had another chance, I think I'll be more concentrated in class. The knowledge is fragmentary and peaceful. If I was more absorbed in class, it will be easier for me to catch the point.",3
913,fl19,hw7,D4CDC9,"I liked the majority of this assignment. I thought that question one was pretty stimulating, but I found myself slightly frustrated because the example code that was given used a tree map for no reason when a priority queue would be much better. I used a priority queue, ignoring the example. The last question I did not enjoy because it required you to reference the information from the lecture slides, but the lecture slides are rather lacking.

914,fl19,hw8,1179BB,"Generally, I think this homework is too much. Problem 1 and problem 2 is okay. However, I do not think we have learned HIVE TEXT PROCESSING in class. And we can not find HIVE TEXT PROCESSING REFERENCE in the PPT. Moreover, Problem 3 is extremely confusing. We can not find product name and the brand in the comment. We learn the Hive and Spark in this homework.",3
915,fl19,hw8,32071B,"Homework 8 is about the practice of HIVE and SPARK. Both of them are methods of process big data. The problems themselves are not hard, but I feel some of the problems are not clearly clarified. For example, 3(d), I don't think the question make sense (either it's too easy or I missed something). I asked TA about this question, he has no clue too. I feel I may not get full score, but it's not my fault. Another thing is that, when I write HIVE statement, I found out there are different ways to get the same solution. Maybe we should learn more about HIVE statement in class. I mean the functions which can improve the efficiency, not the easy SELECT statement.",3
916,fl19,hw8,8B09B7,"What I don’t like about this homework is because the indistinct instructions of Problem 3. First of all, in the very first version of this homework, Problem 3(a) gave a wrong link for reference of the necessary option, which really wasted too much time for me to find the operation which does not exist. Secondly, the instruction of Problem 3(d) is not clear and inconsistent. I hope next time, we can have a direct and correct instruction to help us go through the homework.
If I could start over again, I will firstly update the homework to the newest version. Since I don’t know that there are so many things to be fixed in a homework instruction, I simply believed it and wasted too much time.",3
917,fl19,hw8,C99808,"overall this homework was enjoyable. I liked that I got to learn how to use spark and hive. the sql was challenging because it involved a subquery. the spark was challenging as I had to figure out how to use the three functions that were provided. I would have tried to refresh my sql more if I could restart this homework. This homework was not too hard as it didn't involve java coding, which I liked. This homework was very real world as we got to analyze some data and put it into a database we created. It was overall fun and few negatives.
",3
918,fl19,hw8,CA1572,"The instructions of problem 3 lack important information. Many people posted on piazza but I still can't see clear instructions for (d) and strange results for (c). Although I can imagine what the problem wants us to do, but it's still hard to see why the problem asks some questions that don't fit the data. 

I spent quite a lot of time learning HIVE and sql. It's strange that the common way to find the max/min element is to use ""order by"" plus ""limit"". It's also worth noting that aggregated variables can't appear in ""where"" clause but can appear in ""having"" clause.",3
919,fl19,hw8,CF1A87,"1. I choose the third question. When I do question 3, I am so surprised that the HiveQL can do such complicated analysis. It can help check out which part is wrong and fix it. Also, the time that it takes is very fast.

2. Assuming I could get another chance, I think I would start doing this homework as early as possible. This time's workload is a little bit heavy. It takes me around one whole day to finish it. If I started earlier, I could get more time to think.",3

Secondly, some of the questions are really confusing. For example, I have no idea what I need to do with the third question. Is the dataset wrong or what? Thirdly, the fifth question involving SPARK implementation is quite disappointing because there are no labs or delicate instructions besides the ""not so organized"" powerpoint. One thing makes this homework assignment better off than the others is probably no codes are required.",3

It was interesting to see how efficient Spark and Hive were to producing mapreduce jobs as compared to Hadoop.

The most important thing I learned was how to use Spark to create various RDDS and perform the correct transformations.

922,fl19,hw9,091CBC,"This homework was an alright homework. There were certainly parts I enjoyed but parts that took some time to figure out. The first two parts with spark was a cool way to see how to transform the data into something that we would want and using that info to analyze user behavior. The third question was quite confusing in trying to figure out where all the data was stored and where all the processes were done. We're still not completely sure if we were right on our choices, but we tried out best. The last question was cool. Overall, this homework was one that just needed to be done with and pass. Didn't love it but didn't hate it either.

923,fl19,hw9,1179BB,"Generally, I think this homework is too much. We really spent a lot of time doing this homework. But the good thing about this homework is that the description of the problem is clearer than the last homework. We learned how to use SPARK in this homework. It is annoying that whenever we closed a terminal by mistake, we had to start all over again. ",3
924,fl19,hw9,1F6D48,"I thought that this homework was a nice tour of spark commands. As the key user of the final project, it very well prepared me for my responsibilites. It was a struggle to understand the directed acyclic graph part, as the question was kind of misleading. I think that if I were to do this again, I would re-study the DAG part of the spark and Page Rank jobs. Overall, I thought that this homework was very helpful, but also very tedious. There were a lot of places where things could go awry.

Locally, the jobs executed somewhat reasonably, but in cluster mode they took several minutes. The most important thing I learned was probably to make sure I had everything in the right place, named properly, and the dependencies in order. I was surprised by some of the execution speed, although I should not have been because it was a large dataset. If I could start over again, I would write everything out before diving right in and trying the different commands.

926,fl19,hw9,3E9288,"I like the part which we use spark to do some transformation and solve differentproblems, as we need to think about how the data is formatted in the RDD and try to find a way to transform it to a form which can be used to answer the questions.
One of the things I don't really like is the last question in that part which we need to draw the graph. We can roughly draw a graph but feel it really hard to know which transformations require re-partitioning. We went over the slides and it was still not very clear and the TA we asked could not explain it in a clear way either.

However, once I understood the coding part, the rest was rather easy.  The second part of the homework was dreadful but it helped us understand spark DAG and commands. The question on PageRank was a bit disappointing. I wished to delve more into PageRank but questions were quite shallow.

928,fl19,hw9,65E1AB,"I liked that this assignment forced me to learn about staging and repartitioning (a topic that confused me for a while). However, I felt like the assignment dragged on for a bit too long. I also think the wording for problem 2 is confusing. At first, I didn’t realize what the problem meant when it said to get only the html requests until I got to question 3 about jpg requests. At that point, I had to go back and redo all of problem 2 (I thought it was talking about HTTP requests, in general). I feel like this could be cleared up, and it’s easily what I would do differently if I had to do this again.

It really made me think of storage and efficiency. I enjoyed learning how to use map and reduce functions in python in this homework and on previous homeworks. I wished I started on this homework earlier because I started on the last day, but still managed to be able to finish it. It's sad it's the last homework that we have. I wish there was more programming in this homework. It was a very real world experience as we had to analyze weblog data.

The instructions use the 8088 port, which would be correct if there's no ""/jobbrowser"". By the way, it's nice to have a link for VM troubing-shooting page and the directory for this question is wrong.
The second is the meaning of ""store"" in problem 3. The program doesn't store anything. It's really confusing to understand what the question ""where is the result stored"" wants to ask.
Although the instructions are wrong about the url, I learned how to set this kind of stuff by reading the VM troubing-shooting. I remember well how to see the event logging page.",3

934,fl19,hw1,091CBC,"For the first homework, I really enjoyed actually using what we learned in lecture and applying to real life scenarios provided in the homework. I enjoyed the second problem because it involved doing some real calculations, but the problem was quite difficult, especially for someone without a strong mathematical background. Even after reading the example given in the textbook, it was more difficult to understand why something was calulated the way it is than actually calculating it. It would have been better if a better explanation was given in lecture or if the homework provided more guidance. The third problem was not much reading, but it was hard to digest what the article was talking about. I have some data science knowledge before reading, but I realized if I didn't, it would be extremely difficult to pick up the underlying message that the author was trying to convey. It was a doable homework, but a little rough especially for being the very first homework.

936,fl19,hw1,10B986,"Generally, I like this assignment that each problem in it serves a different purpose. The problem 1 is a reflection of what we learned from class; the problem 2 is an interesting probability question that tells the infeasibility of monitoring evildoers; problem 3 is an extra reading to learn about NLP approaches. However, there is also something I don't like. The description in problem 2 and problem 3(b) are a little vague. To be specific, ""the expected number of sets of p people that will be suspected of evil-doing"" is not easy to understand (I think it is better to say ""How many different combinations of p people that stay at the same hotel on d different days"") and ""What does the model look like"" makes me feel undirected. 

If I could start the homework over again, I would find a partner to work with me. I think the discusstion about question 2 and 3 between us would promote our understanding of the material, and I think the paper in question 3 is great and I would like to talk about it with another person.",4

job of introducing it, I would have like to have seen one more example with it,

Like/Dislike:
I appreciated how the first question paralleled the work whe had done in lecture and the second question directly reference the reading. This help connect crucial starting blocks for me to base my response on. Also, the sample numbers for testing the equations were really helpful in allowing me to catch a part of the formula I hadent considered correctly.

While overall a great homework assignment, I did struggle with the openness of Problem 3's questions. I found the articl very interesting but it was stressful connecting what I read to answering the questions as I had a habit of overthinking what it was asking and second guessing my response since there was no firm answer. 

What I learned:
I believed this assignment helped solidified my understanding of the characteristics of Big Data through the practice with the first assignment. Also the third assignment gave me a much better understanding of unlabeled vs. labeled data and the trade-off between them.

Suprise:
I was pretty supprise by the formula derivation It felt like something out of my probability class. At the time of reading the qeustion, it was hard for me to see th connection between deriving the formula and cloud computing. 

",4
943,fl19,hw1,33EB4A,"1.What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
Ans: I would say in general it is really a good assignment because it is not as difficult as I thought before. Problem I is kind of an extension of what we learned from the lecture and it is easily to solve after reviewing the lecture slides. Problem II is a little bit tricky and it is a pure math/statistics problem that we didn't talk in lecture. Problem III is a readling problem and it is related to what we talked in class as well. I expect that we would have more coding problems in the future.

2.What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
Ans: The most important thing I leaned from this assignment is the characteristics of big data. It gave me a better/deeper understanding of the five characteristics that we talked in class.

3.What suprised, you and why?
Ans: We would have a pure statistics problem in our assignment, even if it is related to the big data. I thought it would be a practical/coding related calss. xD

4.Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?
Ans: I would review my statistics class first because problem 2 costs me a lot of time.

944,fl19,hw1,3986FF,"I would say I really enjoy the part where I reviewed the theoretical knowledge from class, especially part A of the homework; with these knowledge, it would be easier for me to work on the next problems or future ones. I would say the part involving calculations was harder for me, as it took me some time to figure out how to do all the math. The most important thing I learned is to pay attention to the details involved in the course, such as what aspects might be involved in data mining. I was surprised by the fact data mining isn't a panacea, and problems may arise if we abuse it. If I could start over again, I would probably read the book more carefully and memorize important details.
",4
945,fl19,hw1,49B041,"a.
I like some part of this assignment. Like the first two problems. I learned what is the basic information about big data during the class. Through the assignments, I can understand the basic definition better. As for the second problem, I think this problem helps me work better in Mapreduce. I can better design a algorithm. But the last one, to read a paper and get some information makes feel it’s a paper work, not about how to code, how to think. Only some other basic idea about big data.
c.
Actually, in the article that the unlabeled data are more useful amazed me. I always believe that a structed data can be used better, and it is much easier for people to utilize. But I realize that although structed data are easy to handle, it can only bring limited information.
",4
946,fl19,hw1,4EF085,"What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?

The assignment helped me better understand characteristics of Big datasets and recap the simple mathematics I slightly forgot about.  Although instructions were clear, some questions seemed to have multiple answers based on how we interpret the class slide/articles assigned.  

What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
The most important and interesting thing I learned from the homework is from the third question in which I learned about usage of unlabeled data and labeled data.  Although I understood the difference between the two data types, I did not truly see what it meant to be of those two characteristics.  The examples from the article ""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data"" helped me clarify that the way of processing/analyzing unlabeled data can be differ from the labeled data. It led me to try to label my data when possible so the amount of data for research does not get bigger. 

What surprised you, and why?
What surprised me the most is also from the third problem.  The fact that patterns can be detected from the unlabeled data when large information is available led me to think about the strength of CS.  

Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?
If I could start over the homework again, I will read the reading from the second problem more carefully.  Although I read the problem thoroughly, I still misunderstood the probability the question wanted me calculate.

948,fl19,hw1,5B1F10,"I liked that HW1 tested broad knowledge of course materials, from the lectures (problem 1) to the readings (problem 3) to math principles from the text (problem 2). However, I thought that the questions asked in Problem 3 were too vague and difficult to answer as they did not match up well to the terminology and concepts described by the authors of the article. Clearer questions that point to particular points in the article and are more specific about what answer they want would be preferable. I was surprised by the work it took to complete the Bonferroni's Principle question (problem 2) as my partner and I initially struggled to determine the correct formula. Nonetheless, I thought the question was interesting and the exercise of deriving the formula for the general case was beneficial. If I could start the assignment over again, I would have started working on it earlier and been more careful in the derivation of the formula for problem 2 so as to avoid having to troubleshoot and re-derive the formula and to better manage my time
",4
949,fl19,hw1,5B81F6,"
I enjoyed deriving formula on question 2, since it felt like I was solving a puzzle. I did not like the fact that each question dealt with different areas. The first question was analysis, then it was a problem solving question, then lastly it was reading comprehension. Unlike most other homeworks, I had to switch my brain every time I moved to different questions. So I couldn't finish the hw in one sitting, I had to take a break every while.
I learned that reading articles is also important for computer science major. 
In my previous classes, I never had to read anything except documentation. The third question showed me that even a computer science major has to read and that is actually important. What surprised me was when I actually derived the formula. It took me awhile to figure out how to calculate the probability of p group of people going to same hotel on a single day. If I could start again, I will definitely do question 3 first since that took me the most, trying to understand what the article was saying.

The problem 2. Because I think it's a good way for us to learn the power of big data by calculating by ourselves. I like this form because our textbook just give this example and tell us the result.

The second problem is really interesting.

But im not pretty sure what's the meaning of this whole model.

The third problem confuses me.
I am not sure which model or product the auther is talking about and what exact method the auther is using.
Lack of CS background could be one reason.

Lastly the article that is associated with the third question taught me the idea and usage in different types of data sets we have.

P2 was an interesting probability question that extended beyond the example, and it was very rewarding when I solved it. The article was abit difficult to read and the P3 questions were abit ambiguous, so it took me a long time. The Bonferroni Principle was definitely the most surprisingly. I sort of had an intuition of the principle before this homework, but never knew it had a name. This principle was also the most important thing I learned because I will be able to better understand occurances of events of interests in large datasets in the future.

The most interesting problem is 2, since it's a probability problem and consume less time than the other two problems.

This one just makes me feel too much.

The answer for problem 2 actually surprised me. It tells me to choose the thing I'm learning carefully, sometimes just purely random data might generate some pattern if you are not careful enough.

For problem 3, I would go through the entire article at once and then answer the problem. What I actually do is try to find the answers by scan through each paragrapgh. Which is not working for this one. Took me longer than just read through it.",4
968,fl19,hw1,E2A5A7,"Regarding this assignment, I really liked question 2. This was a challenging problem that required quite an amount of thinking to solve (even using the textbook example as a guide). It also helped us see how the sheer amount of data can lead to ""false accusations."" I did not like question 1e), I don't think listing data types really helped me learn anything new, and in general it seemed a little weird to describe some data types (like the links in the wiki pages).

What surprised me most in this assignment was part of the conclusion from question 2. as our parameters become more specific (3 people visited same hotel 3 separate days, compared to 2 people visited same hotel 2 separate days), the chances of false accusations became lower by incredibly large magnitudes. 

Assuming I could start this assignment over, I think I should have reread the powerpoint slides before I answered the first questions. Those questions were a great way to reiterate what we learned in class, as the format was almost exactly as we covered it, I had to rewrite some of my answers after I relooked at the slides.

To be specifically, the occurence of some keys are very large while the occurence of some keys are very some.Under this condition, the reduce tasks for different keys have different run time, which leads to skew. Of course, we have methods to solve this problem, the first solution is to let the number of Reduce tasks be fewer than the number of reduce functions. The basic idea of this soluion is to average the runtime of each Reduce task; The other solution is to let the number of Reduce tasks be larger than the number of compute nodes. The basic idea of this solution is to average the running time of each compute node. To be honest, I dislike the third problem. Actually, I am confused about what this problem whant us do. Although I have read the books, I still couldn't have a better understanding about How YARN works. I know YARN is hadoop's resource management system and it frees the original Jobtracker from the heavy load. But how Job execution and Job submission on YARN is still a mystery for me. I do hope further study can help me get a better and deeper understanding.

1005,fl19,hw3,1DB280,"What I like most about this homework is that it gave me a chance to think all the process through not only about map reduce but also yarn, skew and so on. I got a chance to use them a lot but actually I didn't know much about how the data transferred and what kind of obstacles we'll meet.
What could be improved not only in the homework but also in this course is that I think the most important part as a professional data science or something else, like, SDE, dealing with huge amount of data would be the most significant part. We should get more chance to practice on this.
If I could do it again I'll read the textbook through first instead of looking for informations while writing answers.",4

The theoretical stuff while I understand its importance I enjoyed the questions less. I do however appreciate that the questions and the readings pair together well. In the future I am going to try to switch between reading an answering the questions that way the reading is more fresh. Also I felt like some of the questions are oppinion based and am confused on what they are looking for, next time I need to ask a question in piaza to clarify.

However, I this assignment contains questions like describe a Notion. It is a good review of what we learnt, but the descriptions are in the books or websites. I don’t see the point of describe them again in the assignment. Instead, it would be better if you provided certain situation and ask us how to solve the problem with those notions.",4

1013,fl19,hw3,49B041,"a.	I like the problem 2 most. The skew problem. Actually before this question, I never think about this problem. I also didn’t find it in my book. But after this homework, I learned what is the skew and how to prevent it. So I like this part most. As for the other part, I don’t think they are quite meaningful as this one.
b.	I think the most important thing is be careful to all problems. I always find some spell problems or some other misunderstanding with question. So I make wrong answers many times. Although I will recheck my answer, But I feel it cost me a lot of time. In this assignment, the problem 2. I made some mistakes. I confused the relationship between  reduce task and skew.

1014,fl19,hw3,4C086B,"I found this homework very helpful. I really like the fact that we are going very in-depth as to how Hadoop actually works/operates, and I feel like this assignment has given me a great understanding of how a MapReduce application runs on Hadoop. If I could do anything differently on this homework, I would have started earlier. The most important thing I learned is how different numbers of reduce tasks might affect overall efficiency of a MapReduce application.
",4
1015,fl19,hw3,4EF085,"This homework was helpful because it improved my understanding of the MapReduce process.  I especially liked the problem about the work process and locality really because it helped me understand the process. The most surprising thing I learned during this homework is the fact that when doing a map task, data can be stored/processed locally.  I just did not think of cloud computing to be capable of working locally and on the network at the same time.  If I can start this assignment again, I would look deeper into YARN scheduler. Because I did not understand it well, I was lost where to find the information about it in the slide and when I found it, I still had a difficult time understanding it.

But for the question about sentimental analysis, I think providing us the link of wikipedia is a confusing because it's hardto find it related to the Word Count example. The most important thing I learnedis the MapReduce Job Execution process. I read the textbook and learned more about the difference of MapReduce 1.0 and 2.0. It's helpful to understand why they are adapting the second structure.

1018,fl19,hw3,65E1AB,"I liked that the assignment forced me to learn more about the details of how Hadoop handles job execution with YARN, something I found extremely confusing in class. However, at times I felt like the instructions were unclear and I was unsure of what exactly would merit full credit. It seems like graders are looking for certain keywords, with the lack of those keywords resulting in a loss of credit even if I explained everything correctly on a conceptual basis. I think the most important thing I learned from this homework was the use of a combiner, which seems like an absolutely critical way to improve runtime with certain MapReduce operations.

1019,fl19,hw3,70F7DE,"The homework 3 helped me in getting a clear understanding of the concepts of mapreduce and the various functions associated within. The concept I liked the most is maintaining the efficiency of mapreduce by handling the data skew using combiners and also data locality optimization.The most importtant thing I learnt is that when dealing with huge amounts of data, it needs to be handeled carefully and lot of parameters such as processing time and efficiency have to be taken into consideration.Overall, it was a great homework to work.

1020,fl19,hw3,825E0B,"In this homework, the most important things I learned is the skew of the reduce() function. it help me to understand how the reduce and map processes work and why it has a skew in run time.
I don't like the first question 1. This question ask us to find the words frequency. While this question is simple, I don't think this question can really help us understand how mapreduce work and it upper case and lower case can be ignored easily. ",4

In the lecture, we did not make it to go through all of the slides, so doing this homework is a good way to have a thorough understanding of the process of resource management.
The most important thing I’ve learned is that I finally figure out all of the notations such like Map task, mapper, map() function etc. The notations are easily confused and the notations varies across different materials so sometimes I can’t get the point at the lectures. Thanks to the homework and the table in Problem 2, I finally know why there are different expressions for the same terms.

The assignment also forced me to walk through the steps of YARN, and where Hadoop touches each memory location. This is important because I need to understand the bottlenecks behind Hadoop.

Even though the handout somehow clarifies this inconsistency, I still believe we may address this problem earlier, like the first time we have learned these terms. Or we could write some notices on the slide when we first talk about them so that I could be more aware of these concepts.
I like the idea of skew. I kind of had a similar question during the class and did not get a chance to ask. Now I know how we address this problem. The idea of using a combiner is pretty cool.

In addition, I think it would be very nice if the problem 2 provides information about English vocabulary frequency distribution.

1027,fl19,hw3,D00E29,"As usual, I liked this assignment. I think what stood out was the question about skew. It was nice to have a question that had real-world implications. At work, our data science group had to talk about skew and how certain tables created had high levels of skew, with some having skew values in the 80s-90s due (most likely) to not using unique identifiers as keys. It was nice to have this real-world intuition help to answer this question. Relating to this, I think it was nice to learn more about the technical aspects of skew and how it related to Hadoop architecture.

I found that the questions provided a reasonable challenge and that they helped me deepen my understanding of the material and understand the gaps in my knowledge. Something that I've found somewhat frustrating is that page numbers for books are frequently given, but since all the textbooks are online, there is no way to actually go to a page, so I largely have to guess as to where to go in the textbook. In general, I wish that the slides were much clearer, as the book tends to get into far too much detail. I was surprised by how little coding there was and wish that we were forced to do more coding, as hands-on experience is what actually helps drive the material into memory.

I enjoyed being able to code and run map reduce on an actual example, in this case Shakespeare, as opposed to simply solving for what it should do by hand. I also appreciated how we could find a template for setting up the driver with ToolRunner on the slide deck. Being able to copy a basic model then modifying it was really nice since it allowed me to connect the dots of understanding from the description in the slides to the actual process of how it can be set up, especially in code. I didn't really like question b of problem 2 a bit in which it asked for possible improvements since I didnt really know what to say and I wished I couldve gotten a bit more direction on improvements in what areas it was looking for.

If I had started over on this assignment, I would have definitely started to work on it earlier and hopefully get more help from the TA earlier on since it was a bit of a struggle learning to upload code and work with it in hadoop.

1043,fl19,hw4,49B041,"In this homework, I really like both the problems. Which really help me understand how to use the partitioner and the distributed cache in real work. At first, I understand how they work in theory, But I don’t know how to use them. But after this work, I know how to use them.

If start this homework again, I will try to read some books at first. And I will try to talk to a TA first about what we actually need to do. Because I misunderstand the homework, So it takes me a longer time to design how to program. But later I realize that it is not such difficult as I think.

1044,fl19,hw4,4C086B,"I really appreciated this homework. Starting from a point where we understood what was happening (i.e. a MapReduce job that didn't implement ToolRunner) and updating it to the new form was very helpful. It gave me a better understanding of how Hadoop implements MapReduce both with and without the help of ToolRunner. I wish problems 1b and 1c were a little bit more clear about what they were looking for. If I could start over and do the assignment again, I would've started earlier and spent a little more time planning and learning about the execution process rather than jumping straight in to coding.

Both implementing ToolRunner and writing a Partitioner effectively supplemented my classroom learning by requiring me to develop a more robust and practical understanding of the two concepts. The most important thing I learned from this assignment was the reasons for implementing ToolRunner and the value of using a Partitioner to categorize and divide output. However, as has been a common trend with assignments, the written response questions were written extremely poorly and were consequently unnecessarily difficult to understand. For example, questions 1b and 1c were extremely vague, and I disliked the fact that they did not make sense, and Piazza answers were further unhelpful in understanding the questions. I hope to receive more clear and direct questions in future homework assignments.

It made me think about what the importance of tool runner by first applying it to my own code. I always learn better when I have to apply learning via a project. The second problem was a bit more tricky but it taught me about partitioners. The worst part of the labs are the write ups. I wish we could just submit our code and you check it for functional correctness.


",4
1047,fl19,hw4,70F7DE,"The homework 4 helped me in understanding the practical approach of the mapreduce program.The most important thing is that I have learnt how to apply multiple concepts to a single problem.We applied tool runner, distributed cache and paritioner in a single program which I felt was pretty difficult to solve.It took a lot of time in understanding why the errors were occuring and to debug them.The concept I liked the most is the tool runner which is really helpful in the real world situations as we can provide commandline arguments.On the whole I like the homework but felt it was a little difficult compared to all the assignments given so far.

I also like the idea of testing locally in Eclipse since the compilation takes time. Generally, with the help of these tools, we could compile, run, and test our program faster.

I would read the slides more carefully since actually the usage of the command line has been specified in the slide. It took me a while to be able to correctly pass in the parameter when doing the partitioner. I also would read the examples in the textbook first. These examples helped me to finish this homework.

Firstly, I mistakenly put the txt files into the stubs folder instead of the partition one so that I could not run the unit tests correctly.
Through this homework, I got more familiar to use combiner and partitioner in mapreduce jobs, which can organize the result of mapper to save memory and call several reducers. Meanwhile, this homework stengthened my understanding on distributed cache, side data and toolrunner.

It seems like they indicate the dissimilarity and similarity of the data set respectively. But when I read the book, there exists some differences between the books and lecture slides. These differences make me confused aboutthis concept. Besides, I really like the first problem because it makes me learn and practice how to implement the inverted index in mapreduce. It's really really interesting. I like it! I hope we can have more such practices in further study. Meanwhile, I hope we have relatively rich time to implement these.

I learned how to use it under different situations and the differences among them. 
Assuming I could start over again, I will spent more time studying the materials about how to calculate similarity measures under different situations because at first when I stared to do it, I did it as what I think at the first place, so I made a lot of mistakes and then had to rework it for a long time. So if I could start again, I will learn more before starting doing it.",4
1062,fl19,hw5,25BCEE,"The mapreduce implementation of this project was really fun and was interesting to see the results. The portion that I disliked was having to crunch all the numbers because it was hard to compute without making mistakes. A lot of times, I felt unsure about my answers to many questions. If I had to restart the assignment, I would have started a little earlier and got a better idea of what each of the different measurements of similarity were before trying to simply crunch numbers. Overall, the length and difficulty of the assignment was well suited. ",4
1063,fl19,hw5,32071B,"Hw5 contains two part. The first part is about coding, which I like. The second part is about Similarity Measures (Problem 2 and Problem 3). For the problem 2, I find out that our slides and the book have different definition of cosine similarity, because they treat unrated data different (slides treat them as blank, book treats them as 0). I feel like this inconsistency should be mention in our class, and also talk about their pros and cons. For the problem 3, I feel it worth 30 points. Because I don't have much to talk about it. Also, I feel problem 2(e) and problem 3(b) 3(c) should be treat as one problem. Because they are talking about pros and cons of using different similarity.",4
1064,fl19,hw5,321FD2,"I like this homework since this time it is not as time-consuming as homework4 which is, in my opinion, nice for a weekly homework. It also contains some math work to help us understand the mechanism behind the recommendation system. The most important thing I learned is how to extract the filename as a value and output it. Also, the math behind the recommendation system —— the similarity measure is also important.",4
1065,fl19,hw5,5B1F10,"I liked the opportunity to code in this assignment. I felt that writing the inverted_index MapReduce() program was helpful to my understanding of how to craft a full MapReducer() program, including the Mapper, Reducer, and Driver classes. I was surprised by how math-heavy this assignment was (particularly Problem 2 and Problem 3), but I appreciated the opportunity to apply the various similarity measures in order to better understand their advantages and disadvantages in addition to how to actually calculate them. I believe the most important thing I learned was that the normalized cosine similarity measure and the Pearson correlation measure are actually the same, and the exercise of proving so was fulfilling.
",4
1066,fl19,hw5,65E1AB,"I liked the assignment because it really forced me to understand collaborative filtering, a topic that originally confused me during lecture. One critique I have for the assignment is that Problem 1 felt largely repetitive, and I don’t think I got much out of it other than learning how to retrieve a file’s name in the Mapper and how to set an InputFormat class (both of which I did not feel like warranted an entire question on a homework). Ultimately, I found the collaborative filtering questions to be the most useful thing I learned in this homework.
",4
1067,fl19,hw5,8D0920,"What I did not like about this homework was all the dependencies needed to implement
a relatively small amount of code. I ran into several errors, even though the code was correct,
because the imports were off.

I did like walking thru the example of the similarity measures, and also the thought needed 
into going over which ones are useful and why.

What surprised me was how simple the code was to execute. If I could do things differently 
I would have looked more directly at the book beforehand.

The most important thing I learned is the idea of similarity measures. It help to measure how similar each record is. This can helps recommand system a lot.
",4
1069,fl19,hw5,D00E29,"Homework 5 was significantly better than homework 4. Like the previous homework assignments, I enjoyed the fact that we were able to work on the concepts from lecture that were reinforced in problems 2 and 3. I think the best thing I learned was the proof and intuitively seeing the relationship between the normalized version of the cosine similarity and how the Pearson similarity was equivalent to that. I think I did well doing problems 2 and 3 first, but I would have started the coding earlier and taken advantage of all the TA hours. ",4
1070,fl19,hw5,D4CDC9,"This homework was mostly good. I like problem 1 since I think that coding should be central to every computer science class. I found problem 2 pretty frustrating since you had to put so much in your calculator. I was very afraid that I was going to make a small typo while entering into my calculator and get the wrong answer and thus have the TA mark me down harshly as they often do. Furthermore, I had no clue how much work I was supposed to show as typing equations in latex can be tedious.
",4
1071,fl19,hw5,D5A373,"For this assignment, I like the problem 2. This problem helps me a lot to understand the difference between those similarity measures. Before doing this assignment, I felt confused about the implementations of different similarity measures. But now, I know the theories behind them, also have a sense of their advantages and disadvantages.

One thing surprised me is that the results of those measures are kind of unmatched with my intuition. I’m not sure should I believe the mathematic analysis or not.
",4
1072,fl19,hw5,D6E4CD,"For the problem one, the time for running to get output file is much longer than I expected. Instead of spending time on debugging and compiling, it took me much time to get the output file.
Problem2&3 deepens my understanding for the Jaccard similarity, cosine similarity,and collaborative filtering to learn more about the advantages and disadvantages to measure similarity. Sometimes, the meaning of problems confuses me. For example, I don't know 'repeat part(a)' in problem two means treating the utility as boolean or computing the similarity between each pair of users again.
",4
1073,fl19,hw5,E2EB3B,"i like the similarity measurement calculation part, although it is only a toy example but still helps to understand the concept.
i learned pearson correlation and jaccard similarity.

1074,fl19,hw5,EC3D13,"For HW5, I like Problem 2 and 3 the best because these questions requires reading of the textbook and understanding of basic knowledge of collaborative ratings. The most important thing that I learned is different approaches to calculate the collaborative ratings. It is interesting that to achieve a more accurate calculation, we can manipulate all the ratings (such as give them a threshold).
",4
1075,fl19,hw5,F36F62,"I ignored the first written question about what input format should I use. I ended up spending an hour on this problem. I should’ve think through the questions completely before I start coding. 
I think this home work should give more test cases to test the MR job. Like the previous home work.
",4
1076,fl19,hw5,F38D09,"This homework assignment is really interesting. The name ""inverted index"" itself is somehow not following our intuition. Therefore, understanding the first homework problem is quite a struggle. Once it was understood, then everything is on the right path. Doing all those normalized cosine similarity calculations is quite repetitive. So I think maybe later there could be less repetition in the same kind of problem.",4
1077,fl19,hw5,F5A0C4,"I enjoyed doing the hands-on examples of computing the various similarity metrics and analyzing which one worked best for different cases. I also learned a lot from writing the mapreduce program to take in input file names, as this could have lots of applications for future mapreduce jobs. One thing that surprised me was the ability to use the similarity metrics on datasets that had many incomplete rows, and how to normalize differences amongst individuals in the Pearson metric. If I could start over, I would definitely read through the mapreduce program and determine the mapper input/output and the reducer input/output before starting to write the mapreduce program.
",4
1078,fl19,hw5,F887AA,"This homework was definitely a little better than last one. Although, I spent a lot of time figureing out the coding part. I still am not perfectly sure what was the problem, but my mapreduce kept producing empty files. It only got fixed when I reverted back to one of earliest snapshots I saved, and did almost exactly same thing. It works now, so that was a relief. The rest of the problems were okay. I liked it that it involved some math, as math and calculations are always my strongest game. As much as I love the coding portions, math never betrays you. You will know right away if you're going wrong direction, so I definitely would love to have more questions like problem 2.
",4
1079,fl19,hw6,0071E6,"For this homework, I like the second and the third question. The second question make me learn more about partial sort, global sort and secondary sort. We can define the partitioner by ourself and in this way even if we use more than 1 reducer we can achieve globally sorted. It's obviously we can achieve global sorting by just using one reducer. But in this situation, there are so much work on a single machine. Hence, using just one reducer is a bad idea!  For the third quesiton. it lets me recall the user-based collaborative filtering system. Compared with the user-based CF system, item-based collaborative system will be more efficient when the number of users is much more than the number of items. Besides, it's more easier to classify the similar items since we can readily catch items' features and genres. Also, users profiles might be changed quickly, but items'features or genres changed slowly. Based on these statement. Item-based collaborative system is better than user-based CF system.
And when find the oldest person with the same last name, I get confused at first glance. After re-read the function of each part, this problem get fixed!
",4
1080,fl19,hw6,091CBC,"This homework was a little bit confusing since it was a bit hard wrapping my logic around all of the intermediate steps in between each mapper and reducer since we have so many now. I didn't like how there were certain parts of the code that wasn't really a part of the pre-requisites to this class and I didn't know how to do, but I had to do a lot of googling to figure out what it meant like serialization in Java. The homework was goo practice though. I was able to see more of what was going on between each step along the way from doing this homework.
",4
1081,fl19,hw6,100F16,I like how this assignment helped me gain a clearer understanding of secondary sort and become more familiar with using custom WritableComparable types. It surprises me how we can also approach collaborative filtering problems by computing item-item similarities instead of user-user similarities. We can make recommendations to users using this approach as well.,4
1082,fl19,hw6,1CE70A,"This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of secondary sort and dual collaborative filtering. I do learn more about secondary sort and why do we nned different comparators and how to achieve global sort, etc. I also like the question that ask for a hands on experience with collaborative filtering. That definitel makes me thoroughly understand how that works.",4
1083,fl19,hw6,2CF8F1,"I enjoyed this homework. I think the combination with lab 5 made it not too difficult, but I still learned a lot from the different steps we had to go through.

I enjoyed this homework assignment and I believe it provided a nice balance between content we discussed in lecture as well as lab. Plus, there was little I got confused by. I appreciated that problem 2 was a continuation of the Secondary Sort lab and used the same commands as well as code we had worked on. It was nice to have the core background knowledge of the process before working with it in the homework. I did however get a little confused by question d) of problem 2 as a result I didn’t really like it as much. 

The most important thing I learned this homework was gaining a much more solidified understanding of job modifiers and how to use them through problem two of this homework. 

If I were to do this homework again I would have made sure to finish the last remaining part of the secondary sort lab since it would have prepared me a bit better. 
",4
1088,fl19,hw6,49B041,"In this homework, I really like the code part. It’s actually not so hard. But when you try to write it, you need to take of all the details. When I wrote this code, I made mistake in the CompareTo() part. I made a right compare, but I get a wrong return. So I always failed in the final result. Finally, I fixed the bug. I like this part",4
1089,fl19,hw6,4C086B,"I really enjoyed all aspects of this homework. I feel like I learned a lot about Hadoop and MapReduce. If I could've done something differently, I would've started a lot earlier. I liked analyzing. I also liked the balance between coding applications and theoretical analysis in this homework.
",4
1090,fl19,hw6,4EF085,"During this homework, I liked how we had to define our own StringPairWritable. At first, completing the three methods was confusing. However, when I was able to make it work, I fully understood how other writable objects work. I also enjoyed the problem 3 in which I had to compute the cosine similarity between all pairs of movies.  Through this problem, I was able to understand how each output and input of Job 1 and 2 is formatted and review the calculation of cosine similarity.
",4
1091,fl19,hw6,5B81F6,"One thing I liked about this assignment was that most of the homework consisted of writing codes. That was quite fun but for partitioner, it took me a long time to implement it. I was going to make a double array to store characters in each numReduceTask index but I figured that that would actually make it to run longer than it should be since it would need three for loops. Instead I divided up the range and incremented the return value by 1 if the first character of the word did not fit in the range. If I could start over again, I would actually start with question 2. This is because when I implemented a stringpairwritable in problem 1, it worked perfectly. However, when I just used the same code, problem 2 code did not work at all. So I had hard time figuring it out that we need to return -1 when a is less than b from the slide. So it took me about an hour just to figure that out. 
",4
1092,fl19,hw6,63A21A,"I like the assignment because the custom WritableComparable helps me understand the implementation of Custom Writable interface in MapReduce and review the Inputformat. And the secondary sort problem plays with partitioner,global sort...I think it's a good idea to combine the content of lab with homework to give us a chance to get deep into the concept.And the item-item similarities computation helps me to generate the algorithm based on user-user similarities. If I could do this assignment again, I would remember to specify the input format in driver because I got a type mismatch exception in Mapper when testing the program and spend a while to figure it out.  
",4
1093,fl19,hw6,71A82E,"I like this homework much better than ther prvious onces. Firstly, it has a larger proprotion of coding, which I think better help us digest the settings and alogrithms for the lecture covered this week. Secondly, the questions themselves are much clear and easy to understand than befor. Thanks for making the wording of the questions better. Then part I dislike is that in question we only need to edit one file. 
",4
1094,fl19,hw6,72AE9C,"The part in this homework I like is still the coding part, it really gives me the core idea of what's going on for the Mapper input and output, reducer input and output and what does cosine similarity means. The most important thin I learnt is how to use two methods, which are known as user-user similarity and item-item similarity, to analyze a same set of data. This surprises me because for the sane set of data there are different interpretations. Also I'm sure there are more than two methods for analyzing, so there are more interpretations, which is amazing. I would definitely go over some of the old definitions, like identity reducer, because some of these important definitions are starting to fade away from my memory, which is not helpful for understanding the homework.",4
1095,fl19,hw6,8B09B7,"What I like about this assignment is that the instructions for code design of Problem 1 and Problem 2 are very concise. The instructions said clearly what we need to do to reach out our experiment goal. Some questions are used to guide us a deeper understanding on the    essence of the structure of the work.
The most important thing I learned is the advantage of secondary sort than the naive solution by grouping by key and sorted in Reducer. I think the secondary sort method is very clever which using the property of MapReduce to sort the values by particular key, which saves a lot of time and memory than sorting in Reducer.",4
1096,fl19,hw6,A204CB,"I feel crazy about matching the types. The code and logic is not hard, but it jumps out error frequently about types mismatch, intwritable, long, text, string. And they cannot be directly coverted. Another problem annoying is the debug. I do not know how to watch the process and print parameter value, so I have to guess. And why do we always need to complie it to a jar file and run and open results. I prefer eclipse output, but it keeps output something that less update. I do not know why.
",4
1097,fl19,hw6,D00E29,"Homework 6 was interesting. I think the last problem, while tedious was a good exercise with the fundamentals of how MapReduce works in the context of collaborative filtering. It was also good to combine that with using a measure such as cosine similarity to work through the problems. While coding is key, I think perhaps this assignment should have been due the Thursday after Fall break, have homework 7 assigned with 2 weeks, and for this assignment to have a few more problems like question 3 with the other algorithms we went over in class. Regardless, it is good practice for the eventual midterm. My biggest regret with this assignment had little to do with the assignment and my upgrade to Catalina. It took up most of the week to fix and I couldn't fix some issues to complete the coding section. I wish I waited to download the update. ",4
1098,fl19,hw6,D6E4CD,"For the problem two, it is closely connected with the lab5. Since there are different outcomes after each step. It takes me long time to figure out the parameters setup and understand the meaning for each comparator, which strengthen my understanding to the theroy of secondary sorting. For the problem3, firstly I considered the whole is a single job and get the wrong outcome. I finally get the cosine similarity with two jobs, with job one grouping the movie by their rating and the other calcualting the cosine similarity.
",4
1099,fl19,hw6,E2A5A7,"In this assignment, I liked running through the cosine similarity mapreduce calculation. It was cool to visualize 2 mapreduce jobs working to create a final output which is new since we're only used to doing 1 job. I disliked the fact that there were quite a few movies, users, and ratings because it felt a bit tedious to do the calculation by hand when the same lesson could have been learned through less.

The most important thing I learned in this assignment is the power of adding configurations to your map reduce. This is an extension of the lab, but nonetheless I thought it was very cool how we could change our output just by the arguments passed in the command line, it's much easier than hardcoding.
",4
1100,fl19,hw6,E2EB3B,"i like the coding question and the cosine similarity example.
imorptant thing is that i learned how to write custome writable for different data format.

",4
1101,fl19,hw6,F38D09,"This homework assignment takes a lot of thoughts. Regarding problem 1, it is quite confusing that how the string pair comparator must be used.

1102,fl19,hw7,0071E6,"For this homework, I think the first probelm is a little bit difficult for me. So I pay lots of time on this problem. It requires us to implement two mapreduce job. Thefirst one is really easy, which is similar as the wordCount program we have finished. But for the second job, we should first compute the topN in mapper phase, and thencompute the global topN in the reducer phase. At first glance, I think it's not a big problem. But when I write and implement the second job. I meet some problems.First, I read the data in the mapper phase. and want to directly output (sumOfRatings,MovieTitle). But there are some mistakes when I read file at mapper phase. So I change the strategy: read file in reducer phase. This time I can get the correct answer, but  until now I still have no idea why the first try fails. I think it's logistially correct. The first problem is also the most interested problem, since it's really useful in daily life. And I think I can use it to solve some problems in real life. Additionally, the pair word_co-occurrence might also be useful, but the strips type might be better.

1103,fl19,hw7,208937,"I like this hw much more comparing with the previous homeworks. First of all, due to fall break, I have two weeks to complete this homework so that I don't have to rush to finish it. Secondly, this is the first time I write the driver, mapper and reducer from scratch. Previously, Professor will provide some structures for coding. This time I literally wrote  it by myself. During this period, I make a small mistake. However, the command line just shows an empty result file without any error message. Hence, it took me a long time to discover where the problem is. If I don't have to write the mapper from scratch, I would never have the chance to make this mistake. 
The most important thing I learned from this homework is to be careful to every detail when coding. When I wrote the second job driver, to avoid from scratch, I just copied the first job driver and made some modifications. However, I forgot to change the job name from job1 to job2. As a result, it gave me a workable result file, however, without any result. I tried to find out where the mistake is, it did not give me any error message because job1 itself is correct. Finally, I spent a very long time to detect it. Hence. From this experience, I learned to pay attention to evert detail when coding.",4

",4
1110,fl19,hw7,5B81F6,"What surprised me was that I did not know what to do when I reached TopNMapper since I thought I had to write sorting algorithm. But I saw in lab 6, professor shared a github link that solved a similar problem using topnlist. The person used sorted map to easily sort the data. After that I was able to proceed. Another problem that was difficult was the last one since I did not know how to connect the memory/communication cost we learned from the slides with our implementation. I do not know if I got it correct, but I can assure myself that I tried hard on that problem. If I could go back, I would definitely look at lab 6 slide to check the github link since I implemented aggregatemapper without the help and it increased my runtime significantly.

Fortunately, the second part, based on the example, most part is finished and I need only a little change on them. One of my concern is that, I found the time for finishing the lab is not enough for me. So does the homework. And the hour for TA is usually not enough.

With the help of this web interface, we are now able to quickly get all the information we need.

The coding problems were definitely reasonable and able to be implemented. The only drawback of this assignment was how unclear it was when relating to the communication cost. It was very confusing as to what exactly we were trying to do with that part of problem 3. I wish we talked more about it in class, because it definitely is an involved concept. I think I struggled with little mistakes, so giving myself a little more time would have been ideal. ",4
1119,fl19,hw7,D5A373,"For this assignment, I like the problem 2. This problem helps me a lot to understand what the combiner is. I used to think all the reducers can be reuse as combiners. But after doing this assignment, I understand it is not always true. However, I a bit dislike problem 1. I believe there are many ways to accomplish the goal, but the requirement has a kind of ambiguity. So, I'm not sure I'm correct or not.

If I could start over again, I would ask TA earlier to get some help.
",4
1120,fl19,hw7,D6E4CD,"These three problems are all closely connected with the class contents, and first problem is first time that we implement the mapreduce from the scratch. For the job2 in the top_n_list, I really confused about why the mapper output us null and how can I transform the reducer output from job1 to the composite keys as the mapper output in job2. Also, I have to see mapreduce is really unfriendly to debug and compile and I took lots of time to test my code and see if job can run successfully. For the second and third problem, it leads me to review the combiner part and strengthens my understanding to the communication cost.


",4
1121,fl19,hw7,E2EB3B,"i like the first questiong of the hw7. it was fun!
iv learned that is the communication cost memory allocation issue when comparing different algorithm. I think it is immportant because it is a very useful tips in designing algorithm for a specific problem in the future.
nothing really suprised me.
if given more time i would definitely spend more time on recommendation system algorithms and get a deeper understanding of them.
",4
1122,fl19,hw7,EC3D13,"This hw7 is tough for me, but I like it because Problems 1 and 3 are challenging.  One thing that surprised me is the Combiner, which decreases a lot of FILE reading and writing. If I could start over, I will try Problem 1 differently, such as combining Job1 and Job2 into one job so we can finish this task in one MapReduce task.
",4
1123,fl19,hw8,0071E6," For this homework, I think the first four are relatively basic(but also important). These problems let me be familar with hive operations. And due to this homework I am interested in the rating and comment analysis. Althought I know I just know superfical knowledge about them. But I think I can do more and might div deeper in this field. And the most difficult part for me is the spark part. To be honst, I learn slowly about spark since there are a lot of new knowlege which need me to learn and digest. But I beleieve that I will be the ""friend"" of spark! Also, during this homework, I have some confusion, why should we use spark? what is its advantages and disadvantages? And some of my confusion have be resolved after completing this homework. And I think that the further study will help me to resolve all the confusion that I have.
",4
1124,fl19,hw8,091CBC,"This homework was more enjoyable than some of the previous ones. It was pretty cool to get familiarized with database queries again. Working on some of the hive problems were fun and trying to figure out the correct query was like solving a puzzle so it was fun. The spark portion of the homework was somewhat more difficult since my python background isn't that strong, but it was mostly just figuring out which methods to use at what time, so a lot of googling and looking at documentations.
",4
1125,fl19,hw8,1CE70A,"This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of hive table and spark. I do learn more about the general procedure of hive table and how to play around with spark shell, etc. I don't really like the question 5, although it basically just asks about implementation practices, it would be better if we get more advices and hint. It is frustrating to be trapped by small and minor bugs that is also hard to search on google because it is just too basic.",4
1126,fl19,hw8,1DB280,This is a very interesting homework for practicing writing spark program as well as using HIVE. It's truly friendly that we don't need to write java program in eclipse on a virtual machine anymore that's really horrible ... If I'll do it again then I'll after reading the chapters about that. P.s. I'm not sure that part that asking for the definition of pipelining. Cuz in my view it's a mechanism of MLlib which is clearly not in this case.,4
1127,fl19,hw8,1F6D48,"I thought that this homework was nice because of the SQL part of it. I used SQL every day in my job, so it was nice to be able to use my SQL skills in class. It was difficult to get used to using Python again. I like Python, but getting used to the syntax, espicially the pyspark syntax took some time (like RDD stuff). If I had to redo this again, I would make sure I am familiar with the syntax, and I would begin earlier.
",4
1128,fl19,hw8,208937,"I really like this assignment, basically because this homework contains the problems related to hive, which is a new concept I learned and also spark, so in this assignment, I practiced how to use hive and spark, I did not feel I have started to learn these two concepts until I completed all assignment problems.
The most important thing I learned from this assignment is that pay attention to details when reading the assignment. When I was doing the very last problem in this assignment, I did not pay attention to where to create the folder loudacre, it should be created in the the root directory, however, at first, I just simply think I can create a folder like I did before, which is not in the root directory, when I completed all questions, I suddenly realize I made the folder wrong place and hence have to start over again from the first question, and one more thing I learned is when I deleted the wrong folder, I delete the data which will be used in the next assignment by mistake and then I have to run the lab 8 again to restore the data, which is annoying. Hence, I learned that never be too rush, otherwise I have to spend more time fixing the mistakes. ",4
1129,fl19,hw8,2CF8F1,"This homework was really fun for me, I really like Python and am glad to move away from Java. I think the most important part of this homework was learning how to manipulate and load data in spark and hive.

1130,fl19,hw8,2FE693,This one was cool. I liked doing hive because its like sql. I didn't like spark. If I could restart I wouldn't change a thing. This one wasn't too hard. I'm struggling in another class so this hasn't gotten my focus this week.,4
1131,fl19,hw8,3986FF,"Being honest, this one was much better than the last one, in that all instructions given are much clearer after tweaked. Even though some confusions may occur, discussing with partner would help. Moreover, this hw is pretty much an intro to Hive and Spark, which reduces its difficulty. If I can start over again, I would probably choose to start later than the second version of instructions, which are definitely less confusing than the first one.

",4
1132,fl19,hw8,4C086B,"I like the variety in this homework assignment. Having enough of both Hive and Spark to get a solid introduction while not overloading the amount of information was very useful. I wish there was a little bit more about the usefulness of the pipelining in Spark though. A little refresher of SQL was good for me as well. If I could start this assignment over again, I definitely would've started earlier.
",4
1133,fl19,hw8,4EF085,"This homework was a great practice for using hive commands to form and query tables. Although I like to have coding problems in the homework, this homework was still enjoyable and helpful. What I did not like in this homework was the problem 3. I think the instructions for problem 3 part d and e were a little vague. Especially, in the problem 3 part d, it was not obvious to use the products table. Questions about Part e was resolved once I figured out about the product's brand and name.
",4
1134,fl19,hw8,5B1F10,"I liked the opportunity to use SQL (or, more accurately, Hive) in this lab as SQL is an extremely practical language to know and be able to effectively use for both Business Analysts and Data Analysts. I disliked how vague the questions for Problem 5 were (for example: ""Which SPARk operation can be used to map the information in the second value to separate RDD elements?"" was an awful question). The most important thing I learned was about understanding RDDs and their functionality (including pipelining) although I had to figure most of this out for myself since the lectures were largely unhelpful.
",4
1135,fl19,hw8,5E922A,"The most interesting thing about this homework for me was that there was an opportunity to explore HIVE and Spark in order to create data analysis programs. 
My least favorite thing was that there was too little direction in the last problem in the homework, and I felt like I just had to try to pick unfamiliar functions out of the Spark API to try to solve the problem.
",4
1136,fl19,hw8,5FC843,"Overall I liked this homework significantly better than previous assignments because the emphasis was on coding. I did not like problem 4 because I could not find that many resources in the slides or in the textbook that helped me solve this problem. I think if it s a hw problem it should be more thoroughly discussed in class. I also did not like that confusing wording of the hive queries for problem 3 since I feel the directions should have been more clear.

1137,fl19,hw8,63A21A,"I like this homework because it reinforce the syntax of Hive and Spark. The problems really help me review the lecture and learn about the difference of SQL andHive SQL What I dislike the assignment is that some problems have overlapping content, which is unnecessary.

Till now it was only map and reduce problems in hadoop.From this assignment I got to know about Hive which is very close to sql and  Spark which is a extremely fast in processing large amounts of data.
On the whole , the assignment provided insights into a very intresting concepts in spark such as pipelining etc.

1139,fl19,hw8,72AE9C,"To be honest half of me like this homework and half of me dislike this homework. As usual, the reason I like this homework is it summarize what we have cover from last two weeks, and it refines my coding skill as well, I learned a lot of useful skills such as lambda function. Now, the reason I dislike this is mainly the lack of guidance for coding, I have to search a lot of on google for the function I have to use. Most important thing I learned is lambda anonymous function, it's so important that I think most of the rest material replies on this. One thing that surprises me is how flexible I can extract information from Hive. If I could start again, I want to go office hours instead of searching the function over the internet again and again to avoid wasting time.",4

1141,fl19,hw8,C4AFE7,"I liked this homework, it helped us to focus on hive and spark commands in depth. However, my partner and I felt that instructions on several homeworks were little ambiguous and needed clarification. At some point we needed to imagine ourselves to figure this answer out. Other than that homework 8 was very good.

I was surprised how hive is used in hadoop. I have learn MySQL through cse 330 and my knowledge on utilizing database stopped there. But with this homework I was able to open up my vision on database usage. Also spark with python and scala.

1142,fl19,hw8,D00E29,"This homework assignment was a good introduction to coding with Spark. I enjoyed this, because it was a nice balance of using SQL in the first few questions with PySpark (in my case). I did have trouble with understanding how to interact with the batch of .XML files and I wish I started earlier with that aspect. I was frustrated by the last problem a little bit, due to the fact that I wish we went over more of the ETL process and working with XML files and parsing. I felt a little overwhelmed with that section, but all things considered, it was a fair assignment. ",4
1143,fl19,hw8,D6E4CD,"This homework truly covers lots of topics, ranging from hive peocessing, spark concepts and spark input files processing. I was trapped in probelm 5 for lots of time since the unfamiliar use of spark context and command. Also, since the input is XML format, which is much more complex to see the output in the terminal. Also, I look forward to using spark in the industrial situation since running spark in termial is also somewhat strange and not conveinent enough.

It was really cool to see how we were able to go from really poorly formatted data to the output that we finally got.

I don't like to use spark since sometimes even when the statements go through, there are still a lot of excpetion messeage coming up, I don't know if that is my own computer's issue. I have to go to hdfs to check weather the execution is valid or not, also the exception is really hard for me to understand. so it took me longer to debug.

Besides, as I know, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data is a significant paper published in 2009, I felt happy to get a chance to read it through and analyze it. What I dislike about this assignment is that, Google has published another paper called, Revisiting Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data in Deep Learning Era. It focuses more about computer vision, though. But I think it would be more fun to read these 2 articles together.

2. The most important thing I learned is that sometimes there'll be surprises spending time processing your data rather than spending time improving your model. As we can see, different data sets have completely different data characteristics. And we can know from the article that a simple model with huge amount of data would perform better than a delicate model with limited data. And this is what I learned from my last internship as an algorithm engineer.

1172,fl19,hw1,60A00E,"• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I consider this assignment a very good start for this cloud computing course for it provides me with an overview about the value of massive data especially the third problem. Even though it is not the first time I hear about big data, the sub-problems really make me think more thoroughly about the value and challenges towards big data. 

• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
The most important thing I learned about this course which is quite different from my previous knowledge. Instead of limited data with human cognitive knowledge, we can make the most of unlabeled data because sometimes data can tell the stories itself. I consider it valuable for it helps human being decrease time-consuming tasks by training model with large amount of data automatically.

• What surprised you, and why?
The thing surprised me is that in natural language processing, most of the progress is made in two topics, robot conversation and machine translation, which seem more difficult for me. More surprisingly, the main problems is addressed by big data, providing me with more confidence to technologies with big data.  

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would
you do differently and why?
If I can start over again, I will discuss more about the details in the problems with my teammate instead of solving them mainly on my own because I value some surprising points that I cannot encounter by individual work. After reflection, I hope I can make progress in the future and gain more outside the class.

1.I like the assignment because it provide me a chance to read papers and get more knowledge about this field. Also it serves as a revision of what we learnt in class.
2.I think for me the most important thing is that I learnt an important rule in the paper:  simple models and a lot of data trump more elaborate models based on less data. Because in future I will have many chances to deal with data issues, and choosing an efficient way will be of vital importance.
3.I was surprised by the truth that wikipedia articles can also be considered as big data, because in my mind it’s not a typical dataset.
4. I will read the paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data more thoroghly, because it give me a clear outline of the data analysis process.",5
1177,fl19,hw1,B8F486,"t did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?

What I like most about this assignment is that question 1 is very detailed and covers a lot of concepts we learnt in class. I was confused about the characteristics: size and infinity. I had a more thorough understanding of size after I did question (e) asking about data point and data structures. Also, the question allowed me to see the difference between different data types. 

What surprised you, and why?

I was surprised that we have reflection questions from reading an article. The content is not taught in class or textbook, but is related to our class material. I like that we get to read a little more intense material on our own outside the class. The questions helped a lot in understanding the big ideas of the paper. 
",5
1178,fl19,hw1,BF2FD7,"Dislike of the assignment: 
I think the problem 3 is not that clear enough, since the question is too general and wide, I really don't know how to locate the answer accurately.

What is the most important thing I learned and why I think so:
Through the assignment, I have found out some of my misunderstandings about the topics from lecture, and corrected them immediately. And, the assignment also help me to review the knowledge from lecture.

Assuming I could start over again, what would I do differently:
I think I would first review the slides and read the paper carefully first, since that might save me a lot more time. ",5
1179,fl19,hw1,CF7452,"First of all, I like this homework because hw1 consist of three parts. The first part tested us the knowledge in-class, the second on tested our capability on  statistics and the third one prompted us to do a enlighenting reading carefully.The discussion about data-based model over elaborate model surprised me for the comparision between statistical models and human-defined models.
",5
1180,fl19,hw1,E5DC18,"1. I like the problem 1 and problem 2 because these can help us to review the content we learn in class and practice it. But I do not like the problem 3 because reading paper is difficult for a beginner. I prefer some practice or project assignment.

2. The different dimensions of big data. We should think about 5 characteristics of it and each of them need us to think about different methods in storage, process and use the data.

3. How common the big data is surprised me a lot. I know some data set like credit card record, but do not realize that even the data set of chemical compounds is big enough and have such a huge amount. Big data is everywhere around us.

4. Pay more time to read the paper and answer problem 3 better. Because reading academic paper is my weak part.

1181,fl19,hw1,F5A0C4,"I enjoyed reading about the application of large data along learning about the experimental pipeline of gathering data in the article. I also thought that formalizing the different characteristics that comprise “Big Data” was also useful, in the three examples from Question 1. I thought it was slightly difficult to figure out ambiguous cases that define “Big Data”, especially since some categories are not white-and-black, but gray as well. The most important things I learned were that widely different datasets with drastically different characteristics can all the same be considered “Big Data”, and that large amounts of data can overcome the lack of structure and annotation.",5
1182,fl19,hw2,0071E6,"I like the contents of this assignment. To be specifically, the first problem makes me learn more about HDFS master/slave structure and lets me  get a deeper understanding of some basic but important concepts, such as NameNode, DataNode and Block. Besides, it also gives me an outline of how the file store in HDFS. And the second and the third problem let me be familiar with how to compute the Mapper inputs, Mapper outputs, Reducer inputs and Reducer outputs. 
The most important thing I learned is how files store in HDFS because before this assignment I just have an superficial understanding about this. After this homework,I know the file will be divided into several parts and be stored in several blocks in datanodes. Also it will be copied trice and the replicated data will also be stored in blocks in datanode in different racks which improves the fault tolerance.

1184,fl19,hw2,1DB280,"I like about this assignment is that it lead us to think deeper about the concepts of map reduce.
I dislike about his assignment is that sometimes the distribution of files or how the data was being transferred is not related to what we’re doing while doing cloud computing.
And I dislike the reflection on GradeScope about hw1. Just because my formula is not that big you’re taking away half of my grades you’re kidding me. Next time I’ll write them all in the biggest size, satisfied?",5
1185,fl19,hw2,208937,"I really like this assignment, mainly for two reasons: First of all, the workload is quite fair, it took me about half and an hour to finish it and I think I practiced a lot regarding the coding part and concepts. Second, it is also a more important reason, this assignment has questions about how to write the command line, which requires me to have a deeper memory about the Linux command, has questions about the pros and cons of HDFS, which help me have a better understanding of HDFS theoretically. Also has questions about map function and reduce function. 
Above all, the most important thing I learned is how to write the correct command line in virtual machine. During the process I follow lab1 instructions to store some data in Hadoop, I made some mistakes, which, on the contrary not a bad thing to me. In order to fix these problems, I used the command line with various format, it really helped me understand the code better, since we need to face a much more bigger data size in the real world, and less mistake is better. 
As for what surprised me, it absolutely is the command line! When I followed the instructions and created the correct output, I feel like it is really a dedicate work to do because one little small mistake, maybe a whitespace, will ruin the whole line of command and will not return the result you desire.

I felt hw2 was much smoother than hw1. It was more inline with the slides in lecture and the practice in lab. I also believe that the questions were very clear and constructive. The easily-understandable questions allowed me to move at a much more efficient pase than when they were more open-ended. The homework had a very nice coverage of MapReduce and HDFS, challenging in both practical and definitional knowledge. 
Through homework 2, I solidified my bigger picture of HDFS and its components. I am also much more confident in stepping through any map reduce fuction that is given to me. 
I was plesently suprised to not see a Java coding exercise of MapReduce like that of CSE231.  
",5
1190,fl19,hw2,33EB4A,"1.I like this assignment it provides me with a further understanding of HDFS and MapReduce by asking some critical questions.

2.I am suprised that we still don't have any coding parts to this assignment and the difficuility of the assignment is really fair.

4.I would review the lecture slides and re-do the lab 1 because it took me lots of time to loop up the slides and command lines during this assignment.
",5
1191,fl19,hw2,4EF085,"First of all, this assignment was fun to do.  The second and the third problems were not too challenging but very helpful in understanding the procedure of mapreduce and how the data is processed for intermediate data and the final result.  The less fun part of the homework was the first problem because pieces of information required to know were written in multiple different sources. However, the problem was also helpful in understanding the logic of HDFS.

What surprised me the most is the fact that there are downside of using large block for hdfs.  Since it is a method used for dealing with big data, I thought the size of data won't be a problem that much. 
",5
1192,fl19,hw2,570ACB,"I liked this assignment because it helped me fully understand how MapReduce works. It was a very good practice, especially sketching the cluster state. Problem 2 and 3 were good practices for understanding MapReduce. I wish there could something handson, like areal coding assignment that asks us to write a Mapper and a Reducer ourselves, but I amsure this kind of assignment is on its way. I wasn't surprised by anything. The last question of problem 1 took me a while because I didn't know how the data transfer works. Later I realized that I was probably overthinking it. 
",5
1193,fl19,hw2,5B1F10,"I liked Problems 2 and 3 the most out of this assignment. While we have covered a few examples of how MapReduce works in lecture, being able to walk through the steps of Mapping, Grouping & Sorting, and Reducing sample data at my own pace was extremely helpful to my understanding of the concepts. I believe this practice will help me both with implementing MapReduce functions in the future and with my general understanding of the process. The most important thing I learned from this homework assignment is more about some of the advantages and disadvantages of the HDFS standard replication factor and distributed file systems more generally. Having the opportunity to think more deeply about these pros and cons should be helpful to my understanding of future material in addition to understanding when HDFS is likely to be effective and when it is not. Lastly, I was a bit surprised by the fact that Problems 2 and 3 were not too difficult. I expected to struggle more with implementing MapReduce by hand but was pleased to find that I was quite able to implement each of the steps and comprehend how the data would be stored and how it would look at each step.

The most important thing I have learned in this homework is knowing that HDFS does not work well in every case. HDFS is really powerful but still has some weakness.

I also liked the first question, because while I thought I had a working understanding of HDFS, I actually didn't understand it as well as I thought. I had to use the readings to make sure I really understood about HDFS.

The most important thing I learned was how to think about why things in HDFS are sized the way they are. For example, while the reflection factor might have seemed arbitrary to me at first, it now makes sense why the replication factor has to be sufficiently large, but also must not be too large (too much data used).

Assuming I could start the assignment over again, I think I would go back to the drawings we did before lab1 going over what the HDFS looks like. I think that would have made it easier to visualize what the HDFS that I draw should look like.

Answer at least 2 of the following questions:
•  What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I like it so much, more than any of previous two. The reasons are as follows:
1. I develop my own studying style in solving the questions: 
- take a glance at the question and  understand it
- try to look back on the related topic in class and have a brief overview on how to solve the problems 
- read HDTG and MMDS thoroughly according to the calendar guidance
- form answers by own words

I think this homework is really helpful when it comes to solve about one confusing question in terms of Hadoop. That is the relationship between HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, Spark and Hive. After reading HDTG, I got the answer: from bottom to top, the layer comes in order: distributed file system (HDFS,HBase), compute (YARN), execute (MapReduce, Spark). Hive is a tool running SQL on top of Hadoop.

The hypothetical questions of 100 to 10000 Reduce tasks provides a spectrum of variation of how much tasks should be made in order to most efficiently carry out the MapReduce jobs. Question 3 also provides a good opportunity for us to walk through the process of Hadoop 2. In overall, the homework was a good review of what we learned in class.
",5
1230,fl19,hw3,D5A373,"I like question 2 for this homework. Before doing this homework, I have no idea with “Skew”. But after reading the book and answering this question, I understand this concept and how to reduce the impact of it. It’s really helpful for learning how the Map-reduce work.
The most important thing for me is to consider every step of the Map-reduce job. There are a lot of things may help the user improve the performance of their work.
",5
1231,fl19,hw3,E0A335,"What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I like this assignment because it includes a lot of reading and theoritical problems, which I think is necessary for an engineer student, we not only have to know how we can do the job, we also have to know why this works. Also I like reading with a queston, like Hw1 and 2, we have a problem just like that.

What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
I think the most important thing I learned from this assignment is the use of sombiner and how it could used to avoid data skew during the MapReduce process. Also I get a sence on how the numebr of Reduce task nodes affects the skew and other properities of the MapReduce tasks.


",5
1232,fl19,hw3,E2EB3B,"I like the second problem which require me to do a lot of reading before i can answer the question. it seems a short question but really takes effort. good design.
i learned about the very detailed version of how yarn work in hadoop
the improvement suggestiong in problem 1 actually surprised me. i haven't thought about sentiment analysis thoroughly.

i would study more about sentiment analysis.

1233,fl19,hw3,F36F62,"I learned that textbook is the most reliable resource. When I googled about where the data are stored. I get all kinds of answers. Those answers are not technically wrong, but they are confusing. On the other hand, the textbook gives the precise answer and reasoning.
I surprised by the wc command in Linux. I used with wc command before. But I don’t know that -l can count the lines of the file. I would check the manual of commands I used a lot. Just to see what I don’t know about those frequently used commands.
",5
1234,fl19,hw4,100F16,The most important thing I learned is how to use ToolRunner to enable passing job configuration parameters in command line and how to retrieve the parameters. This made me appreciate the flexibility that ToolRunner provides. I am also surprised to learn how distributed cache is used and how it can expand the types of tasks we can do with MapReduce.,5
1235,fl19,hw4,1CE70A,"This homework is generally fair and straightforward, basically going through the whole process of toolrunner and partitioning. I do learn more about these 2 concepts through gands on experience with them. I also like the question that ask out how we can improve the sentiment statistics because that sounds like more real world application. Indeed, the functions and methods we have now are never perfect and we should always be looking for a way to improve it.",5
1236,fl19,hw4,21E0D7,"I definitely enjoyed building my own partitioner and being able to see how that creates a more organizedreduce output based on what we plan to do with it afterward. The most important thing that I learned is probably this as well, that using a partitioner could create different reducer file outputs, making it much easier for us to conduct analyses on these outputs later. If I could start over again, I would have actually done the lab 4 before this, since there was a lot of information from that lab that would have been useful in this homework assignment. Something I did not like about the asignment is that running the jar file on the hadoop cluster took a very large amount of time
",5
1237,fl19,hw4,24F3DE,"I really enjoyed this assignment. I was a big fan of how this homework tied in with the lab, and I liked the coding aspect. In the future for this homework I am going to try to start earlier so if I run into silly errors I can get help to catch them earlier on rather than struggling to figure them out on my own late at night. Overall I really enjoyed this assignment.

What I like about the assignment is that I get the hands-on experience on how to implement ToolRunner and Partitioner.

ToolRunner is super useful, powerful and flexible. We could use it to test different configurations.

1239,fl19,hw4,33EB4A,"1.I like this assignment because it is really challenging, especially for the coding parts. It provides me with a futher understanding of how MapReducer works and JAVA implementation. 

2.I am suprised that our first coding assignment is really complicated. The question itself is fair but it takes me much time to debug. 

4.I would re-do the lab 3 and review my JAVA programming knowledge because some of the materials/questions in this assignment are really high-level thinking and requires strong base JAVA coding skill.
",5
1240,fl19,hw4,4EF085,"I like the lab as a whole because unlike the previous labs, the questions were based on the codes we wrote and the outputs of those files.  The coding part of the lab was straight forward with sample codes from the workspace folder and from the lecture slides.  In all, this lab was designed to be an engaging learning experience.  The most important thing I learned through this lab was the concept of partitioning.  I was not sure how the partition process works during the MapReduce and this lab clarified that unsureness.  I did not know if it partitioning processed randomly based on the number of reducers or if it had to be specified.
",5
1241,fl19,hw4,570ACB,"I like this assignment a lot because I get to do a lot of hands-on testing with hadoop partitioner. I feel like I am getting increasingly fluent in command line language and hadoop commands. I learned a lot about how partitioners work, which I was not so familiar with before. I wished Problem 2 could have more instructions, like how to use the SentimentPartitionTest file. I spent a long time trying to figure out how to run it with no end, but overall it's a good assignment.

",5
1242,fl19,hw4,58093E,"I thoroughly enjoyed this homework assignment because it allowed me to code and do actual analysis on real data using map reduce. I thought it was well designed, an appropriate length, and moderately challenging, as a good homework assignment should be. I hope that all of our future assignments are structured this way. I feel confident in my abilities after this assignment.
",5
1243,fl19,hw4,5B81F6,"This homework was quite intense, since it was the first time we had to code for homework in this class. However, it was worth it because I was able to learn so much by coding instead of just learning about mapreduce through lectures. However, I had hard time coding the partitioner but it was not because it was a hard concept but rather I just forgot how java syntax works. But mostly, it was enjoyable since I just had to sit down and code for most of the time. I think question 2 asked some questions that might help us in the future, since we are going to work more with sentiments of words. It was a great homework since I got to learn how to use mapreduce with toolrunner and add arguments and configuration via command lines. This was much easier than adding them in java files or eclipse configuration. Overall, I think this was a quality homework. 
",5
1244,fl19,hw4,5E922A,"I thing I enjoyed most about this homework is that it was focused mainly on practical applications. This allowed me to solidify various concepts we learned in class, by seeing how they could be applied to actual code.

The most important thing I learned was how to load data into the distributed cache, and how to use a partitioner. I think this is important because these topics are seem most applicable to future assignments and projects.
",5
1245,fl19,hw4,60A00E,"•  What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why?
I like it very much because this assignment has to do with practical problems, which in my opinion is much more helpful. In details, to implement a practice problem, we need to understand the theoretical part first and deeply. Based on that, we can deal with the problem much easier. In addition, when we are coding, we need to try to figure out the error messages when we run into a bug. This can really help us improve our coding.

•  What surprised you, and why?
One thing that surprises me is that there is not rule of thumb solution when we are setting the number of reducer. This is a bit disappointing because I am really a person who consider practical tricks important. However, what the lecturer covered in lab session indeed matters to me for the reason that even though it doesn't explicitly point out the number of reducer, it gives me some hint at least. For example, we need to consider data skew issues when configuring this number setting.",5

All we were talking about were concepts in class and I'm longing for this coding for two whole weeks. Coding really gives me how model works, I also learnt some of the Java skills that were new to me. The part that surprises me is such a complicated system of model can actually be coded in this small scale. I thought it took hundreds of thousands of lines of code to implement. One thing I'm a little working about is the insufficiency of me to completely understand the whole code, I mean I get what I implemented, but for the whole thing I'm still confused at some point.

What I didn't like about this assignment was a) commenting the code. There is 0 need to comment code
that is explicit in what it does already. It actually makes it less readable. Yet, we were forced to comment
the code anyways. I did not like this. 

Secondly, the instructions were no good. Specifically, question 1 could use a lot of rephrasing. 
It was unclear what we needed to test or write down. I had to ask for several clarifications.

There're some errors in original files. I'm not sure if it's on purpose or it's because of  the different version os Java.

Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would you do differently and why?
If I could start over I would go to the TA hour to ask about how to read the txt file line by line into the program. I spent almost an hour to figure this out.

One thing I did not like was again the long runtime of the job, taking several minutes to run on the hadoop cluster. One thing that took us a lot of time was that we forgot to unpack the data inside, just transfering the tgz to the hadoop filesystem, which made it so that our outputs were not in human-readable format. Once we remembered to do this, then it started to work.

In the lecture we went over the calculations but I could not understand the concept of cosine similarity. Then while doing the homework I realized that thiscalculation was similar to that of variance. The reason that we use variance was to remove any extremity. I believe that a similar approach was used in cosine similarity in that we get variance in denominator to reduce extremity in calculation. Another thing that I learned was that cosine similarity cares about scales when Jaccard does not. When I understood this, homework became pretty easy. Coding part was quite similar to previous ones, so it was quite doable.

1277,fl19,hw5,60A00E,"In general, I am a little bit disappointed with this homework five for the reasons that:
1. There are many conflicts between the content from textbook and that from lecturer, especially the Jaccard Similarity Method. In my opinion, the value of homework is to test whether or not we are familiar with the similarity calculation. In this case, the meaning of question should be clearly clarified.
2. There are some content that might be overlapped. 

If given another chance to start over again, I will definitely review the outline of the class related to this homework according to the calendar shown on the website. Then, I will open the class note and the textbook, Mining of Massive Datasets simultaneously, in order to carefully discover the difference between the method to calculate similarity. 

In all, this big data application class is really useful for I'm a data engineer who once aimed at recommendation system especially item-based collaborative filtering. When the course covers something I'm familiar with, I can dive deeper into the topic.",5

1280,fl19,hw5,72AE9C,"By far this is my favorite homework, I like the combination of code part and the calculation part. I like how you make me practice how to code then use examples of Jaccard similarity and cosine similarity to let me review what the process is. Therefore I have to go in to the book to take a look at the original example to get familiar with the calculation process, which is helpful. The most important thing I have learnt from this homework is biased opinion	from people are unavoidable, so I have to be careful when dealing with data. The surprising part about this homework is there are actually tutorials about how to implement Jaccard and cosine similarities in python and java, which I would definitely do if I get a chance to start over again, because doing the calculation by hand is simply time consuming.",5
1281,fl19,hw5,8BBD0C,"Overall, i think that the most important thing i learned is how to use different input formats for the input data.

",5
1283,fl19,hw5,BA8FC1,"I especially like problem 2. The example in MMD is a very useful guide to help me get this problem done. More importantly, part (c) and (d) shows me that the similarity measure could be modified and improved. And there could be some intrinsic relationships between different measures. Also, some good steps, such as normalization, in the preprocessing could produce a better result. This also inspired me to think of other possible ways to preprocess the data to improve the quality of measure.
I probably would review some knowledge of statistics. I found this knowledge helped me truly understand the meaning of the Pearson correlation. In other words, it is necessary to understand why the Pearson correlation is defined in this form instead of just implementing and using it.

1289,fl19,hw6,208937,"I really like this assignment. Basically for two reasons: For the first two problems, I tried to write stringpairwritable.java and used it when running mapreduce jobs. This is the first time I write it by myself instead of using default functions in java. And then I encountered problems when I run the job. I tried to figure out where the problem is and aft first I thought it was I had the wrong reducer function. And after I looked through questions in piazza, then I realized the problem was not in reducer, it was in my stringpairwritable. From this, I learned that when writing the code, every detail will affect the final result, and we have to dig deeper to see where the problem really is in and do not focus on the last step ahead of the problem. Second, I wrote the answers of problem 3 manually and then I went through all the process of collaborative filtering and had an enhanced understanding regarding the concepts.
If I had the chance to do the assignment again, I will tell myself to think about the whole picture of problem1's code when I encountered the bug. Because as I wrote above, I learned that every detail in coding is important to the final result, hence if there occurs a problem, there may be a bug in several steps ahead. We should try to solve problems with a general picture, not a cluster of coding files.",5
1290,fl19,hw6,2176F7,"I like this assignment very much, for that it covers all kinds of tasks from coding, analysis and computation. All of these tasks are quite challenging and inspires me to think about the main idea of Hadoop carefully. The most important thing I learned from hw6 is the usage of sort comparator and group comparator. The sort comparator does the sorting, while the group comparator processes the data for each group. The two class both help relieve the workload of the reducer and implement additional functions.",5
1291,fl19,hw6,21E0D7,"I enjoyed first implementing and then seeing the effects of a custom partitioner, plus learning a bit about the implementation of comparables. A dislike is again the long runtimes of our jobs when testing on the hadoop cluster. The most important thing I learned is probably how to write a custom partitioner based on what we intend todo, because then we can customize the sorting based on what we want to do. I was surprised to learn that sometimes, different people were returned because we only sorted by last name and the year of birth, not by the full date, and thus sometimes the youngest person of a particular last name may have been different for different runs. If I could start over from the beginning, I would have tried to build up the nswer to problem 3b based on mapper 1 outputs, reducer 1 inputs and outputs, mapper 2 inputs and outputs, reducer 2 inputs, and reducer 2 outputs.

In the future I would ask more questions and start earlier.

Also I realized how I could implement the toCompare method to make them globally sort as the output. It was very interesting to find out how one more number, which was negative 1, could affect the outcome.

Secondly, if I could start over this assignment again. I would start using without the StringPairWritable. I would love to see what StringPairWritable provides us in comfort.

Instead of spending a ton of time trying to get the code to work, I spent the time understanding the “why” behind the code working, which I feel like really enhanced my understanding of the Mapreduce job.

I believe there are many ways to accomplish the goal, but the requirement has a kind of ambiguity. So, I'm not sure I'm correct or not.

If I could start again on this assignment, I would code even more incrementally than what I did, I think I tried coding incrementally, but only tested on the smallest of inputs, I would have tried to pull a tiny subset of data and maybe even used unit tests.

I loved that we got to work with Netflix's real data, and I thought it was a fun challenge to try to figure out the best way to build a map reduce job to get the top n movies. I wish I knew more about the stripes method, but I hope we get to implement one in the future.

Most important hting I learned was probably the lazy execution/pipelining, which greatly sped up the process of running. I was surprised that three comments including ten times more were the exact same, just because it's very unlikely that three comments will be identical in the real wordl.

doing something significant. It required me to think a lot on my feet and to 
think about how best to run queries on a dataset. 

I also enjoyed how there was a story associated with everything we were doing because
it really made me think we were doing some sort of real life task that a data scientist
might do, and these tools that we're using are especially relevant.

The spark part, while still interesting, I didn't like as much because it didn't make
as much sense to me why we were doing what we were doing and also what we were looking at.

Both Hive and Spark was at first a little challenging for me at first because i was so used to the Hadoop's system of job registration through Java. However, as I got more used to the syntax of Scala, I was more enabled in easily registering multiple MapReduce jobs without having to code out each components in Java, and that was a huge time saver. I was surprised as I was going through the problem sets that such complex jobs were instantly called via a single line of code through Spark. I do, however, think that I need to get used to the Sparks lack of output of logs while on the job, since I'm so used to observing the jobs go and being ensured that it's going well.

I used to think is should be almost the same as the traditional SQL Queries in Mysql database.Indeed, they are similar, but after doing this assignment, I understand that the queries in Hive are kind of more suitable Hadoop.

If I could start over again, I would ask TA earlier to get some help.
Also, I would like to read the book before starting the homework.

I liked that fact how for hive, we had different small problems to implement the concepts we learned both from class and the lab on our own. It was also a great opportunity to review SQL. Problem 5, for getting used to spark, was pretty fun to work on. It took me and my team member a little bit to get used to the syntax, but that was not too much trouble. Overall, this homework was nicely distributed between hive and spark, and also was not too frustrating to solve. I really liked this homework.

However, I would like to have more practice with pagerank as I am still not quite familiar with the algorithm. I am surprised by how easily written python is comparing to java, not mentioning c, and how much I still need to catch up with python. Also I learnt difference between map and flatMap, the hard way.

1358,fl19,hw9,1DB280,What I like most about this homework is that it shows us how to use spark correctly and fully practice it. And it provides a chance for us to construct a DAG graph for the whole process. If I'll do this again I'll read the piazza post first then I can know how to avoid getting stuck on the join command and redo all the process again lol.,5
1359,fl19,hw9,208937,"I like this assignment very much. First of all, it is much easier than the previous homework, I feel really relaxing after completing the homework. Secondly, I become more and more skillful about the spark and know how to write the programs , execute them and successfully get results from them. That's the most important thing I'm happy with the homework. 
As for the thing I learned from this assignment is there are multiple ways for us to complete tasks. we can use Hadoop as what we did before to complete the tasks, but also we can now use spark to retrieve the results. And spark is a more efficient and effective way. Hence it is not enough when we master a new skill. We have to explore more and find more ways for it, in this way, we can complete various tasks more effectively and efficnently.",5
1360,fl19,hw9,2176F7,"I like this hw9. It mainly focuses on the Spark, but with two different ways of working. We first practiced with the interactive spark shell, and then wrote a python file to execute program. The most important thing I learned from this homework is DAG (directed acyclic graph). DAG plans for the execution process of Spark. It is really a good way to go through the resolution and understand the problem deeply.",5
1361,fl19,hw9,24F3DE,"I really liked that this assignment got to use more python and spark. I also like how this assignment challenged us to think through a lot more of the problems and what happens at each stage of the process. Drawing the DAG was nice to see how the flow worked and made it easy to identify any bottlenecks. Also I made use of checking PIAZA which was super helpful, I had one job where there was a join and it was getting stuck at 311/315 and if you ran it with pyspark --master yarn it solved the problem. This issue was most likey due to a memory constraint but with out the piaza post wouldv'e been extremely difficult to resolve the issue for ssomething that is such an easy fix. In the future I will continue to check PIAZA for most useful information on the assignment. Also as a side note on the last problem I would've like to seen that problem go one step further and actually represent the web graph in a matrix and solve for the pagerank.

that were very connected and let me do a deep dive into Spark. I appreciated this
assignment because it made me think in terms of how to practically code, and also
in terms of what's going on behind the scenes for memory placement and efficiency

As I was going through the writing our own application part of the homework, I learned that pyspark will allow me to make my job process even more easier by not having to compile. I was previously using Scala a lot since I was more used to Java, but the appeal of not having to compile was what made me switch over to Pyspark. It was very fun to try out coding a job in python, and it came to me as a vast difference of worktime in making such a job from trying to do the same thing with Java.

It was a little frustrating for some parts because my hue website (localhost jobbrowser) wouldn't appear correctly. Also, bunch of errors and warnings popped up when we tried running the stub file.

I was most surprised by the clarity and specificity that even a large dataset like “web text” was analyzed with – there was reference made to column headings, table contents.

I spend sometime to go over the previous PPT to find the correct InputFormat.

I also encountered troubles when dealing with math problems. It seems that definition of Jaccard are not quite accurate under some circumstances. ",na
1415,fl19,hw5,E5DC18,"1. I like it! Because problem1 gives me chance to try harder question instead of just copying the code from slides. P2 and P3 let me solid my knowledge in COLLABORATIVE FILTERING and recommond system.
2. Knowing what are you coding for. Because this can help us solve the problem that we do not meet before.
3. Math is hard!
4. Study Math harder. TAT

1416,fl19,hw5,F62B7D,"• What did you like/dislike about the assignment and why? 
It is rather interesting to do this assignment since there’re many kinds of different problems for me to think about. What I dislike is the problem 3a. I am really confused about the description. The equation is too obvious and I could find no way to “show formally”.

• What is the most important thing you learned and why do you think so?
The getPath().getName() method. Without the hint and implementation in this assignment I might never find this usage.

• What surprised you, and why?
The interesting result of different similarity calculations.

• Assuming you could start over again (with working on the assignment), what would
you do differently and why?
I’ll use program to calculate the tings in problem 2 for me.

1417,fl19,hw6,0C302F,"This homework was pretty good. I liked how we did a problem in lab that was the same as problem 3. I understood the problem better because it was done in lab once. The problem I found to be more difficult was problem 2, because when I removed the argument, the output wasn't correct. It took my partner and I a while to figure it out. Overall, I liked this homework.

1418,fl19,hw6,5E922A,"I thought that the worst part of this homework assignment was that the mapper and reducer output and input computations in the last problem were overly tedious and somewhat confusing because in the slides it indicates that that task should use multiple map jobs, the question seems to imply that you only need one.
I thought the most useful part of this assignment was the review of concepts from lab 5, because it will be applicable in creating map reduce programs from scratch in the future.

The workload was just right, and it blended coding for practical purposes as well as doing calulcations
by hand. It made me think about which approaches were most effective and why.

There's not really anything that I did not like about this homework. I would like to dive deeper into
the collaborative filtering, and which use cases are more effective for certain reasons. 
I also felt I could have coded one of the approaches from the given pseudocode on the slides.

3.I was surprised by the fact that we can use a hashCode() function to generate the hashcode for each StringPairWrittable object.

It helps me to get familiar to other part of MR program, which is very helpful.

How to modify comparators and partitioner.

The MR frame can do so many things itself, like partition, with only a little work on configuration.

you do differently and why?
I’ll think about the Q3 more thoroughly.

I do learn more about the general procedure of Top-N lists and how to implement a word co-occurrence method, etc. I also like the question that ask about the difference between Stripes and Pairs and to calculate memory requirements and communication cost.

While there's some trouble I've met since my VirtualBox was shut down accidentally and everything was gone, but we finally made it work.

The word occurrence one is interesting too cuz when I'm trying to make examples to show that bi-gram is not that efficiency, I re-read All's Well that End's Well one more time and it reminded me good old days.",na

I thought the third question relating to communication costs was rather vague in what it was asking for and I think improvements can be made there.

I feel like I don't understand some of the theory behind all of this and if I were to redo this lab I would first go back to the slides and do a thorough review",na

In the job counter part, there're ""File input"" and ""HDFS file input"". At first, I was confused by these two definition. Then, I figured out that ""File input"" may be the intermediate result like group&sort result.

Problem 3 also was something we have never seen before and I wish it was brought up in class. Other than that problems 1 and 2 involving RDD’s were fair game and I think they tested my knowledge.
